6146>>0>> Argentine bonds were slightly higher in a small technical bounce Wednesday amid low volume. A trader at a large foreign bank said there was a slight technical bounce at the opening, and he did not expect prices to change much during the session as no market-moving news is expected. The 5.5 percent dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 rose $0.15 to 115.15. Argentina's FRB due 2005 rose 1/8 to 77-3/8. "There is general uncertainty," said the trader, pointing to all the events the market is waiting for, including the passage of the government's new economic measures through Congress, which is now not expected until early October. In addition, traders are awaiting a meeting Friday between Economy Minister Roque Fernandez and an International Monetary Fund delegation on Argentina's fiscal deficit. -- Axel Bugge, Buenos Aires Newsroom, 541 318-0668
18586>>0>> Germany's Volkswagen AG , unveiling a new Passat car aimed at boosting its share of the mid-size market, said on Wednesday its total sales for the first seven months of 1996 were up in Europe and the world. The Wolfsburg-based carmaker said worldwide deliveries to customers from January to July were up 13.5 percent to 2.35 million vehicles, while deliveries in western Europe were up 11.3 percent to 1.451 million vehicles. But the German market for Europe's largest carmaker was still anaemic, with growth at only 2.8 percent in the period. VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech said late on Tuesday at a news conference to unveil the new Passat, slated for release in October, that VW has "witnessed a slight pick-up" in the German market in the last few weeks. He said the increase could stimulate German sales in the second half of 1996 and reaffirmed that VW expected full-year profits to top the 1995 level. VW also said it wanted to double its 1995 third quarter group net profit of 72 million marks ($48.67 million) in 1996. VW shares surged on the news, ending Frankfurt bourse trade up 14.50 marks at 551.50 marks, a gain of nearly three percent. The higher sales come at a critical time for VW, which has been distracted by a battle with the European Commission over controversial subsidies to build vehicles -- including the new Passat -- at plants in former communist East Germany. VW said on Wednesday it was considering filing its own complaint against the European Commission after the state Saxony filed a suit last Friday against the commission with the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. VW chief legal officer Jens Neumann told reporters the decision to take legal action, which must be reached by Sept 16, depends on progress in talks between Bonn and Brussels. Both Bonn and Brussels have indicated they were preparing complaints but both said the focus for now was on discussions. The choice of Saxony's capital of Dresden as a site to launch the new car, built on the same platform as the popular Audi A4 as part of a cost-cutting strategy, was no accident. Piech again backed Saxony's decision to give the 90 million marks in questioned subsidies, saying the aid in question was a small amount to the carmaker but important to Saxony for creating jobs. He also denied allegations VW was blackmailing Saxony by threatening to leave if it did not get the funds. Some 430 of the new Passats, which are styled after the A4 but will be about 3,000 marks cheaper than the similar Audi base model, will be made each working day in Saxony, he said. "We believe that the decision by the premier of Saxony to grant subsidies to Volkswagen is a decision for the people and for jobs in Saxony," Piech said. Top VW executives have put enormous expectations on the new Passat, first introduced in 1973. VW plans to double its Passat production to about 300,000 for western Europe in 1997, with half as saloons and the other as estate wagons. "Our performance in the the middle-size class has so far been considerably below what we would like it to be," said VW management board member Robert Buechelhofer said. VW has long drawn strength from the Golf, one of the top-selling compact models in Europe for the last decade. But VW is limping in the mid-size class. During the first half of 1996, the Passat ranked a mere fifth in the mid-size west European market with only a 6.6 percent market share. German automobile trade magazines have given high ratings to the Passat but have teased VW, which said at the weekend it had discovered a surveillance camera at its German test track, for "spying" on its Audi luxury carmaker unit for styling help. Piech downplayed the similarities and concerns about fighting one another for sales. "We see no problem," Piech said. "Our goal is to take sales more away from Mercedes and BMW, not one another."

22170>>0>> The U.S. 30-year Treasury bond will likely remain under pressure in a shortened pre-holiday session on Friday, traders and analysts said. The Treasury market will close at 1400 EDT/1800 GMT on Friday, ahead of the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Monday. Bearish technicals also signal the benchmark long bond will not have the stamina to move back below the 7.0 percent yield level that has proved its anchor this week, they added. "The technical picture was busted today," said MMS International analyst James Padinha.   Pressured by reports of an upward revision of the second- quarter gross domestic product and strong July new home sales, the September bond contract broke through support at 108 16/32 to end down 21/32 at 108 4/3. "We're now looking at 107 6/32 on the September bond contract," Padinha said. Meanwhile, the 6-3/4-percent 30-year cash bond ended down 23/32 at 96-12/32 to yield 7.04 percent. Pandinha said it is difficult to predict tomorrow's market action based on the fundamentals since there are no major economic reports slated for release on Friday.   But the MMS International analyst said the market could use the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index for August, scheduled for release at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT as an excuse to sell in the face of bearish technicals. "Definitely, the risk of another selloff is there. The market is weak, technically," Padinha warned. Though the Chicago PMI only contains limited information about the national economy, it is often regarded as an indicator of the trend in the first major report released each month -- the National Association of Purchasing Management Index.   MCM MoneyWatch senior economist Astrid Adolfson said the shortened session ahead of a long weekend that will keep U.S. markets closed for three days may just accentuate moves. "Whatever trading there'll be on the Chicago PMI, by 11:30 (EDT) everybody will be gone. People are likely to want to sell. There is no reason to go long ahead of the long weekend and the employment report next week," Adolfson forecast. The NAPM August index will be released on September 3. Traders said this report may have a bigger market impact than usual since it will be the first U.S. release after the end of the vacation season in Europe and the United States.   Adolfson also noted there usually is some month-end buying ahead of Labor Day -- but little sign of it this time around. "We're are so bearish getting into next week, there is no buying of consequence," she said, stressing the market's uncertainty about the August employment to be released on September 6. A preliminary Reuter survey sees August payrolls up 238,000, with the unemployment rate at 5.3 percent and the average hourly earnings up 0.3 percent -- strong numbers that do not fit in the Federal Resaerve's forecast for moderate growth in the second half of the year.   Traders expected the market to remain under pressure until it sees economic data that would give a clearer picture of the Fed's policy outlook. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York temporarily added reserves via six-day fixed system repurchase agreements on Thursday to meet currency demand around the Labor day holiday. The Fed may supplement this operation on Friday with another round of multi-day system repos. If it does so, the Fed is likely to intervene sooner than its usual 1130 EDT/1530 GMT time due to the shortened trading session. -- 212-859-1666
22513>>0>> Iranian security forces have broken up five espionage rings in northwestern Iran and arrested 41 people on charges of spying for unnamed countries, a daily newspaper said on Thursday. Jomhuri Eslami quoted the West Azerbaijan province security chief as saying those held confessed to gathering confidential information, photographing strategic sites, doing propaganda against state officials and "spreading pan-Turkism". It was not clear if they were the same five spy rings, allegedly led by Turkish diplomats, that Iran said in April it had broken up in the same area, which borders Turkey. The April arrests were announced shortly after a row in which Tehran asked Ankara to withdraw four Turkish diplomats accused of spying, and Turkey expelled four Iranian diplomats for their alleged links to killings of Iranian exiles. Ties between the two neighbours, strained also over a military accord between Turkey and Israel which drew strong Iranian objections, have improved since Islamist Necmettin Erbakan took over as Turkish prime minister in June. The daily Iran on Thursday quoted Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahiyan as saying agents arrested 137 people for allegedly spying for Iraq, the United States and other unnamed countries in the Iranian year which ended on March 19.

39496>>1>> Volkswagen AG management board chairman Ferdinand Piech said in an interview on Sunday he intended to boost the German carmaker's meagre return on sales level more than tenfold by the turn of the century. Piech said in the interview with Der Spiegel magazine that VW, Europe's largest carmaker, would keep up its cost-cutting measures and seek more favourable contracts from suppliers. Piech, 56, said he viewed Chrysler Corp. as a model for Volkswagen since the U.S. carmaker had produced a similar number of vehicles -- about two million -- during the first six months of 1996. He noted Chrysler had a return on sales of 6.6 percent compared to only 0.6 percent at VW during the 1996 first half. Piech also said VW was "about a quarter of the way" on the road to reaching the goals he set out when he took over at the Wolfsburg-based carmaker in 1993. When asked if VW could achieve its goal of a return on sales against pre-tax profits of at least 6.5 percent by 2000, Piech told the magazine, "We have higher goals than just that. We want to become the most successful carmaker in Europe." "We always show this to our employees. Our return on sales is represented by a golf ball, Chrysler's by a big medicine ball," Piech said in the interview. He also expressed confidence that VW's struggling Spanish subsidiary SEAT would return to profitability. But Piech was vague in saying how long embattled SEAT chairman Juan Llorens would remain with the carmaker. "If Mr. Llorens reaches retirement age, then he will be replaced with a competent manager," Piech said. He noted that the average retirement age for top VW managers was 55 to 65. German publications have speculated that VW would not extend the contrct of Llorens when it expires in November, saying Piech was unhappy with the Seat restructuring. Piech said VW's new version of the Passat saloon marked the start of VW moving into the higher-price range for luxury cars. Piech said VW, which owns luxury carmaker Audi AG, could envision offering a car for about 150,000 marks ($101,000) under the VW name that would cost about 200,000 marks at other carmakers. "Volkswagen is for the citizen what Mercedes is for the establishment," Piech said. But he added, "We could push forward into higher price regions." Piech said VW would not create a new brand such as Toyota did in creating Lexus but would instead expand on the Passat, which is designed like and built on the same platform as the popular Audi A4. He dismissed criticism that the decision to use fewer production platforms led to fewer ways to distinguish between VW-made vehicles under the VW, Audi, Skoda and SEAT brands. "The differences will always be there but only when the customer also sees, hears and feels" the vehicles, he said. In the lower price range, Piech said VW was lining up its new Audi A3 compact, the VW Golf and the redesigned Beetle to compete against Mercedes' new A-class small vehicle. "Three against one, that should be sufficient," he said. Piech also reaffirmed his support for controversial VW management board member Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who is at the centre of a legal fight between VW and General Motors Corp over allegations Lopez stole secret GM documents. Lopez was GM's purchasing czar at its German-based Opel division when he defected to VW in March 1993. GM has filed a U.S. lawsuit against VW, which also names Piech. VW has denied GM's claims and filed its own suit charging GM with defamation. "Volkswagen is not involved in industrial espionage," Piech said in the interview. "I am fully convinced of his personal character... One must meet him before passing judgment." ($1=1.4854 Mark)
46547>>1>> A bill intended to curb economic espionage by foreign countries and companies was passed on Wednesday by the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. The bill would make it a federal crime to steal trade secrets. Persons convicted of economic spying could be sentenced to up to 25 years in prison and organisations could be fined up to $10 million. The legislation was drawn up in response to warnings by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Central Intelligence Agency of increased economic espionage against U.S. companies by foreign governments and companies seeking technological advances. France and Russia were among the countries citied by the FBI and the CIA. U.S. officials said current laws often did not cover the theft of ideas such as computer software. The bill is expected to be approved by both the full House and Senate before Congress adjourns for the year this month.

61329>>0>> A North Korean infiltration into the enemy South on Wednesday is one of many that have occurred since the 1950-53 Korean War. Wednesday's drama is the 310th incident of infiltration and espionage since 1970, the South Korean Defence Ministry said. Following is a chronology of the major incidents: January 21, 1968 - Thirty-one armed North Korean agents reach the presidential Blue House in Seoul, 28 are killed in a fierce gunbattle in which 34 South Korean troops, police and civilians also die. October 30, 1968 - A total of 130 armed North Koreans slip in through the east coast areas of Uljin and Samchok. Some 110 are killed after exchanges of gunfire in which 70 Southern troops and civilians also die. Seven are captured. June 12, 1969 - North Korean espionage vessel with 15 people on board sails into the remote, southeast island of Huksando. All infiltrators are killed in a gunbattle. April 4, 1970 - North Koran espionage vessel infiltrates tiny western island of Gyokyolbiyol. South Korean troops kill 17 agents. June 21, 1981 - South Korean armed forces destroy North Korean espionage vessel off west coast city of Sosan, killing nine and capturing one alive. September 24, 1984 - Armed North Korean agent commits suicide by taking poison after murdering three people in the country's third largest city of Taegu. May 22, 1992 - Three armed North Koreans infiltrate just south of the inter-Korean border. All are shot and killed. October 24, 1995 - A North Korean spy is captured and his companion killed in clash with security forces in southern city of Puyo. They had landed on Cheju island on a midget submarine on September 2.
61780>>0>> The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), defender of war victims and political prisoners around the globe, on Wednesday rejected U.S. charges that key officials had worked for Nazi Germany in World War Two. The Swiss-run body, which holds the Nobel Peace Prize for its activities, said U.S. agents who made the claims in reports to Washington near the end of the war appeared to be ignorant of how it worked or what its mandated role was. Initial investigation since the charges became public in the United States in August made it possible "to refute the majority of the allegations of espionage and even of the infiltration of the ICRC by German agents", it declared. But it said there had been one "sordid affair" in early 1945 involving an ICRC official in Turkey. He was found by police there to have gold coins he claimed to have been given by a Hungarian journalist a U.S. report said was a Nazi agent. In another case, a Swiss national who had worked in the ICRC war prisoners' agency in Geneva for a year in 1941-42 but resigned and went to North Africa was arrested by the Free French authorities in 1943 and shot for spying a year later. Documents containing the charges were recently discovered in the U.S. National Archives by researchers for the World Jewish Congress (WJC) trying to trace the assets of victims of the Holocaust, the Nazi drive to eliminate the Jews. Their publication coincided with allegations by the New York-based WJC that Swiss banks were still secretly holding gold and other assets of Jews killed by the Nazis and wealth looted in occupied countries and sent to Switzerland from Germany. The 130-year-old ICRC, which has no formal link with the Swiss government, said it had taken the charges against it and some of its wartime officials -- known as delegates -- seriously and had begun research in its own archives. But initial findings showed that of 21 people identified as its representatives in reports from agents of the U.S. wartime intelligence agency, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), released by the WJC, only 16 actually had worked for it. "The other individuals mentioned, indeed those against whom the most serious allegations have been made, did not work for the ICRC," a statement from the body said. "In several cases, ICRC delegates were labelled as 'enemy agents' and accused of espionage simply because the U.S. agent had no idea whatsoever of the ICRC's mandate," the humanitarian body, which acts as a neutral intermediary in wars, said. "As yet, the ICRC cannot certify that there were no Nazi (or other!) agents in its ranks during the Second World War," the statement declared. But it said it was already clear that OSS agents "misinterpreted activities carried out entirely openly and with the consent or at the request of the Allies, and qualified them wrongly as espionage". In one document, an unnamed OSS operative reported what he regarded as the suspicious communication by an ICRC delegate in Algiers to the German authorities of technical details of a vessel, the SS Canada. In fact, the statement said, the ICRC had been asked by the French government-in-exile in Algiers in 1943 to notify the German and Italian authorities that the vessel was being put into service as a hospital ship. Another OSS agent, cited by the WJC researchers, reported that the ICRC in Tunis had communicated to Berlin the names of two representatives of German war prisoners in Allied camps in North Africa -- suggesting this was espionage. "Yet this was normal ICRC practice: the ICRC communicated information about millions of prisoners of war to their states of origin and their relatives," the statement declared. Many other charges in the OSS documents were based on rumour. The body, which last year said it recognised it was guilty of "moral failure" for not publicly denouncing atrocities against Jews and others in Nazi concentration camps, said it would be pursuing its research. It would also be sending a mission to the United States shortly to share the results so far with the WJC and New York Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato, chairman of the Senate's Banking Committee, who is also investigating the matter.
62325>>1>> The House of Representatives Tuesday voted to make the theft of U.S. trade secrets by foreign governments and companies a federal crime. Sponsors of the bill, which passed 399-3, said U.S. companies were losing $24 billion a year from the theft of computer software, technology and other intellectual property. They said current federal laws did not cover such crimes. "The federal government has been frustrated in its efforts to combat these crimes because existing laws are insufficent. This bill gives federal agencies the tools they need to fight economic espionage," said Representative Stephen Buyer, an Indiana Republican. "It will also send a clear message to foreign countries, including many of our allies," added Representative Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat. The FBI and CIA have said that several foreign countries, including France and Russia try to steal U.S. trade secrets. The bill now goes to the Senate.
63261>>1>> A bill to make the theft of U.S. trade secrets by foreign governments and companies a federal crime was heading for final congressional action after approval by the Senate. The Senate version of the bill, passed Wednesday night, must be reconciled with a different House version passed by the House Tuesday. Final action is expected by next week, a House Judiciary Committee staff member said. Sponsors of the bill said U.S. companies were losing $24 billion a year from the theft of computer software, advanced technology and other intellectual property. They said current federal laws did not cover such crimes. The FBI and CIA have said that several foreign countries, including France and Russia, try to steal U.S. trade secrets.
77909>>0>> Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended Thursday. LONDON - British shares closed little changed, struggling for direction in thin end-of-quarter trading. The market got some support from higher bonds after further signs the U.S. economy was not as strong as thought. The FTSE 100 ended down 2.5 points at 3,933.2. FRANKFURT - Positive market signals and a smattering of good corporate news sent shares to new records in bourse trade, but dealings were marked by selective buying interest and weak volumes. The 30-share DAX index continued its bull run to end the floor session up 7.58 at 2,666.55 points. In post-bourse trade the index rose 1.86 to 2,664.96. PARIS - French shares closed slightly higher after a series of disappointing first half results and a weaker start at Wall Street eroded initial gains. The market jumped after the news of a 3.1 percent fall in U.S. August durable goods, which could indicate a slowdown in U.S. activity, but the gains were short-lived. The blue-chip CAC-40 index was up 0.73 points at 2,104.14. ZURICH - Swiss shares ended slightly higher in moderate volume but below a barrier of 3,700 points on the blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI), despite edging over the line during the day. Profit taking and a weak Wall Street opening led to late losses. The all-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI) firmed 3.86 points to 2,374.65 points. TOKYO - Stocks closed higher, marking the third straight day of gains on the back of rising high-tech shares. Brokers said the stock average was likely to keep its firm tone at least until the end of September, but the 22,000 level would be temporary resistance.

81463>>0>> Divers combing the Nile River on Friday recovered 14 bodies and are looking for at least 40 more after a ferry capsized with 75 people on board off a southern Egyptian village, security sources said. Nineteen people were rescued on Thursday night after the ferry sank while carrying the villagers home from a funeral. "When I saw the boat sinking I screamed at the top of my lungs...I only saw the people for a flash and then it went under," said grocer Zaghloul Fares of the Sheikh Tamy village. The interior ministry said the boat, a four-metre (13 foot) long sailing vessel, was grossly overloaded. Security sources and survivors said it hit a barge, listed and sank. Cairo newspapers published in their Saturday editions stories of distraught survivors. "While we were on the way back, I noticed the very young son of the captain was holding the rudder. I warned him to let go but his father scolded me," survivor Mohammed Khalifa told the Al-Akhbar newspaper. "Shortly after, the boat veered and hit a barge and we all were tipped to one side and jumped off. I managed to hang onto the barge and was saved in the nick of time." "I also managed to pull up 10 others onto the barge but I could not save my best friend Yasser and I saw him drown in front of my eyes," Khalifa, 21, added. The accident happened near the ancient tombs at Beni Hassan, in Minya province about 260 km (160 miles) south of Cairo, after a funeral on the west bank of the river. The river is several hundred metres (yards) wide at that point and the current is strong. Police have detained the ferry captain, 59-year-old Ahmed Mohammed Munir, for questioning and ordered a widescale investigation into the facilities of other ferry boats. Anxious families were lining the river bank, waiting for bodies to float up and diving themselves to look for their kin. Women doused themselves in dust in an age-old mourning tradition and distraught elders cried for missing relatives. Divers will continue their search until Sunday but have broken off until dawn. A wire net has been erected to prevent any bodies floating downstream.
82330>>1>> Two German men were detained by police on Friday after one confessed he planted a camera at the test track of carmaker Volkswagen AG and sold photographs to car industry publications, a prosecutor said. The men, who were 39 and 44 years old, were not employed by Volkswagen or a rival, public prosecutor Eckehard Niestroj said in announcing the breakthrough in one of Germany's most spectacular cases of industrial espionage. Police said the men were discovered after a resident of southern Germany tipped police off to a man in Starnberg who had expertise with high-tech photographic equipment and was known to visit the test tracks of German car manufacturers. The 44-year-old man admitted that he had confessed to installing the camera and to taking covert pictures of the VW prototypes while the other has declined comment, Niestroj said. The names of the men, whose residences in Starnberg and the state of Saarland in southwest Germany have been searched by police, were not made public. Both of the men turned themselves into police once the investigation was launched and were being held in jail to prevent them from tampering with evidence, police said. VW, which declined on Friday comment on the investigation, announced in August that it had discovered the sophisticated camera at its Ehra-Lessin test track. The device apparently used heat sensors and sent photographs by means of radio or satellite technology to the home of one of the suspects, police said. Four unauthorised photographs of VW prototypes appeared in car magazines in recent months, leading the carmaker to suspect that its security system had been penetrated. The photographs were of VW's new Golf, Passat and the EA-420 model under development. Premature publication of such photographs can cost a carmaker millions of marks in lost sales because innovative body styling can be copied or preempted by rivals before the introduction of a new vehicle. Pictures of new models and prototypes are highly valued by specialist motoring magazines, and some photographers go to considerable lengths to get them. VW has said it was spending a three-digit-million mark sum to develop a new car model, of which 30 percent is to be spent on design and body styling. VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech has said he believed the carmaker, the largest in Europe, has been under surveillance for about eight years and suspected news photographers were not behind the pictures. After discovering the cameras, VW hired organised crime expert Dieter Langendoerfer as its new security chief. Langendoerfer is scheduled to begin work at VW next week.
82454>>1>> German authorities said on Friday that two men have been detained on suspicion of industrial spying at German carmaker Volkswagen AG. The two men were believed to have planted secret cameras at a test track operated by Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker. VW said the cameras, discovered last summer, had apparently sent out photographs of vehicles under development.   The public prosecutor's office in Braunschweig, located near the Wolfsburg headquarters of VW, said the men did not work for Volkswagen or to competing car manufacturers. "These men did not work for Volkswagen or another car company," said prosecutor Eckehard Niestroj. VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech said in late August that the cameras had been sending out photographs from the track for some time, noting that he believed VW had been under surveillance for about eight years. VW probed for cameras at the test track after four unauthorised photographs of prototypes appeared in car magazines in recent months. Pictures of new models and prototypes are highly valued by industry magazines. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
82912>>0>> Divers have recovered 10 bodies from the Nile River and are looking for at least 50 more after a ferry carrying 75 people capsized off a southern Egyptian village, security sources said on Friday. Nineteen people were rescued on Thursday night after the ferry sank as it carried villagers home from a funeral. Security sources said the ferry and a barge carrying goods collided, but the Interior Ministry said the ferry should not have carried more than 50 people and was overloaded.
