<p>The head of Adam Opel AG said on Monday the German carmaker would defend its top European market position despite plans by parent General Motors Corp to use Opel to launch an ambitious global expansion plan.</p>
<p>Opel managing director David Herman told Reuters that the company would keep building vehicles to meet German and European interests and that the international expansion plan was critical to securing Opel's future.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone who says you can afford somehow to turn your eyes away from Germany and Europe is making a mistake,&quot; Herman, whose contract was renewed last week for another five years, said in an interview at Opel's headquarters outside Frankfurt.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not doing that. I think we should earn a little bit of time before people make up their minds.&quot;</p>
<p>A weekend report in Der Spiegel magazine said an internal survey of top GM officials in Europe criticised GM's expansion strategy, saying the carmaker needed to devote more resources to European product development and quality measures.</p>
<p>Some Opel officials have also complained privately that top managers were being taken away from Opel tasks for the project under the direction of GM International President Louis Hughes, hampering development of new Opel models.</p>
<p>Herman said he stood behind the GM expansion plan, which calls for Opel to be used as a base to boost output by about 700,000 vehicles early next century through new plants in such countries as Argentina, Poland, Brazil, Thailand and China.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to see Opel as an even larger participant in growing world markets,&quot; he said. &quot;We have the resources, both financially and in human resources, for these projects.&quot;</p>
<p>Opel is helping to develop several of the plants since many will produce Opel vehicles. It will then turn many of the plants over to GM and receive royalty payments from production.</p>
<p>Herman also said the resignation last week of Juergen Stockmar, a top Opel board member, was due to personal reasons and not his dissatisfaction with GM's expansion plans, which includes reducing the number of vehicle platforms to seven from the current 16 in coming years.</p>
<p>German media reports said Stockmar, the Opel board member in charge of technical development, quit in protest over having too little time to devote to work on Opel products.</p>
<p>&quot;He did not think they were not good strategies. He personally had another vision of what he wanted to do, which was to stay here and work on the European challenges for Opel,&quot; Herman said of Stockmar, who was replaced by Peter Hanenberger.</p>
<p>Opel, like rival carmakers Volkswagen AG and Ford Motor Co, has seen its market share erode this year and is under pressure to offer new products to regain lost sales.</p>
<p>Opel's market share dropped to 11.8 percent in the first five months of 1997 from 12.4 a year earlier, while sales dropped four percent to 689,694 vehicles.</p>
<p>VW sales dropped four percent to 635,710 in the first five months for a 10.9 percent market share, compared with 11.3 percent in the 1996 period. Ford's sales have fallen six percent to 649,383 and its market share to 11.1 percent from 11.9.</p>
<p>&quot;All of the volume makers have lost market share. But on a relative basis we have not really lost ground,&quot; he said. &quot;Our ambition is to be at about 12 percent at the end of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>Herman said one reason for Opel's slow sales was intense price pressure and big sales incentives from Asian makers, which boosted their market share to 11.4 percent in the first five months of 1997 from 10.7 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;The European car market certainly does not provide much reason for optimism, either from a volume standpoint or from the dynamics within it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Herman also said Opel had not made a final decision on how to deal with excess capacity in the industry. Some media reports have said Opel was considering scenarios to reduce up to 6,000 jobs from its German workforce of 45,000.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not based on some notion that we are going to produce less cars or sell less cars in Germany,&quot; he said. &quot;New investments and products will allow us to employ less people. This is a process that has been under way for some time.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Opel did not plan to export vehicles out of central Europe, where it has a growing presence in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, to western European markets.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not planning to close down west European plants to import products from cheaper locations,&quot; he said.</p>
