<headline>FOCUS-German prosecutor drops Daimler probe.</headline>

<p>The Stuttgart public prosecutors' office said on Tuesday it had dropped an investigation into top managers at Daimler-Benz AG because it had found no evidence that they misled shareholders.</p>
<p>The office started an investigation after a shareholder filed a legal complaint alleging Daimler executives withheld negative information about the group's financial health at an annual general meeting in May 1995.</p>
<p>Edzard Reuter, then chief executive, had forecast at the meeting that profits would rise by a third in 1995 whereas the group went on to post the biggest company loss in German history -- 5.7 billion marks ($3.7 billion) -- for the year.</p>
<p>That loss was linked to a big restructuring launched by Reuter's successor, Juergen Schrempp.</p>
<p>But the prosecutors' office said Daimler had not breached German shareholder law. Executives found guilty of deliberately misleading shareholders can be sentenced to upto three years in jail.</p>
<p>&quot;The investigation has not confirmed the accusation of a deliberate false presentation of the company's economic condition,&quot; the prosecutors' office said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Losses of the stated extent were not yet foreseeable for the management nor the supervisory board in May 1995.&quot;</p>
<p>The shareholder's complaint had been directed against Reuter, Schrempp, chief financial officer Manfred Gentz and supervisory board chairman Hilmar Kopper.</p>
<p>Investors welcomed the news, which helped push up Daimler's share price by 2.05 marks to 102.75. The company said in a statement it had never doubted that the management painted an accurate picture of the company at the time.</p>
<p>But the affair has not been fully resolved yet.</p>
<p>Germany's securities trading watchdog said on Friday it would again investigate whether Daimler breached a share trading law by making the profit forecast.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Federal Securities Trading Supervisory Authority Office said the office would examine documents handed over by the prosecutors.</p>
<p>The office had already investigated the matter in 1995 but had found no evidence of any breach of rules. Daimler-Benz said in a statement it was taking a &quot;relaxed view&quot; of the new probe.</p>
<p>The prosecutor's office said losses that had arisen in the first quarter of 1995, which Daimler did not publish, merely indicated the risk that Daimler may post a loss of 0.3 billion marks for the full year.</p>
<p>Withholding the first-quarter loss and the risk it entailed did not breach German shareholder law, the office said.</p>
<p>Despite the first-quarter loss, the management board saw no need to correct the profit forecast it had made because it expected to be able to compensate during the rest of the year, following the trend of previous years, the office said.</p>
<p>Extrapolating a full-year outlook from the first-quarter loss would have amounted to a highly uncertain forecast because of exchange rate volatility at the time, the office said.</p>
<p>The management board had assumed earnings to improve by the end of 1995 amid an expected appreciation of the dollar, the office said.</p>
