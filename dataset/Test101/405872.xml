<headline>Analysts say VW drop on results unwarranted.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-02-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>Some industry analysts on Wednesday said a drop in the price of Volkswagen AG shares due to disappointment about the German carmaker's 1996 results was unwarranted and reiterated their buy recommendations.</p>
<p>VW on Tuesday said group profit rose 102 percent to 678 million marks on the back of a 14 percent rise in group sales to 100.1 billion marks.</p>
<p>The Wolfsburg-based carmaker also proposed raising its dividend payout on ordinary shares to nine marks from six marks and on preference shares to 10 marks from seven marks.</p>
<p>Dealers said the profit figure was below a number of market forecasts, prompting VW's shares to fall to as low as 789 marks before ending bourse trade down 6.50 marks at 791.50 marks.</p>
<p>VW's shares in post-bourse IBIS trade kept paring gains and were trading at 793 marks.</p>
<p>The following are summaries of comments made by analysts:</p>
<p>HANS HARTMANN, DRESDNER KLEINWORT BENSON, FRANKFURT:</p>
<p>Hartmann on Tuesday night repeated his buy recommendation on Volkswagen after the results were released.</p>
<p>SABINE BLUEMEL, IMI SIGECO, LONDON:</p>
<p>Bluemel, who maintained her buy recommendation on VW, said in a report that VW's profit figure was &quot;well below&quot; her forecast for 925 million marks and below market expectations for 800 million to one billion marks.</p>
<p>But Bluemel said VW's conservative accounting methods and high provisioning made the results a poor measure of VW's general improvement.</p>
<p>She said the dividend increase was positive and reflected VW's &quot;optimistic outlook for business development&quot; and revenue growth was higher than expectations and were above the growth in volume sales, which rose 13.6 percent to 3.76 million cars.</p>
<p>Bluemel said she had left unchanged her earnings-per-share estimates for 1997 at 65 marks and for 1998 at 99 marks.</p>
<p>HORST FREY, ABN AMRO, FRANKFURT:</p>
<p>Frey, who has a buy rating on VW, said the carmaker had &quot;hidden its profit&quot; and that a lack of understanding about VW's accounting policies may have led to misunderstanding among some investors and that the carmaker has a strong potential.</p>
<p>Frey said the dividend increases were a &quot;positive surprise&quot; for investors and that investors should be patient for the full impact of VW's turnaround strategy to take hold in 1998 as profit margins keep improving in 1997.</p>
<p>He recommended &quot;aggressive buying&quot; of VW on any price dips.</p>
<p>JUERGEN PIEPER, DEUTSCHE MORGAN GRENFELL, FRANKFURT:</p>
<p>Pieper said the drop in VW shares was a false reaction to the results and kept his &quot;overweight&quot; recommendation on the carmaker along with his DVFA earnings per share forecast at 33 marks.</p>
<p>He also expected the 1996 profit figure of 678 million marks to be reduced to about 470 million marks when subjected to the accounting standards under DVFA rules.</p>
