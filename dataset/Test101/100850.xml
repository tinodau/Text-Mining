<title>NETHERLANDS: Inflation, GDP derivatives seen on the way.</title>
<headline>Inflation, GDP derivatives seen on the way.</headline>

<p>Companies may soon be able to trade derivatives of major economic indicators, such as inflation and Gross Domestic Product (GDP), as a hedge against business risks, a seminar was told on Monday.</p>
<p>Adrian Maconick, head of risk management at London-based Deloitte and Touche Consulting Group, said he saw demand from companies for derivatives products based on economic variables.</p>
<p>&quot;All sorts of things can be commoditised and, once they're a commodity, you can have a futures and an options exchange to manage the risk,&quot; he told a seminar on Financial Markets in 2000 at a two-day derivatives forum in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Maconick said the technology used in exchange-traded options and futures businesses could be applied in a wider arena.</p>
<p>He could not predict when he believed derivative products based on economic indicators would be introduced but believed it was technically feasible to do it.</p>
<p>After the seminar, Maconick told Reuters he expected strong demand from companies for products that addressed business risk, which he saw as bigger for companies than financial risk.</p>
<p>He said companies could deal with many of these challenges internally, but they would also need specific derivatives to deal with specific risks.</p>
<p>&quot;The most obvious ones are the big economic variables -- things like GDP and inflation. There's no technical reason why these cannot become derivatives,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, there isn't a clear market to handle it.&quot;</p>
<p>Business risks include changes in demand for a company's products while financial risks include movements in interest rates and currencies.</p>
<p>Maconick said firms could currently get tailor-made &quot;one-off&quot; products or use surrogates for these indicators, such as metal prices, which tended to move in line with economic activity, but these left a mismatch between risk and hedging.</p>
