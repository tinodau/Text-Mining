<p>The head of Romania's Foreign Intelligence Service (SIE) has resigned over a spy scandal involving Switzerland, President Emil Constantinescu's press office said on Thursday.</p>
<p>General Ioan Talpes tendered his resignation to Constantinescu, taking the blame for the case of a Swiss diplomat arrested by Berne over accusations of spying for Romania, a statement said.</p>
<p>Romania's top spy agencies -- the SIE and the domestic spy-catchers, the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI) -- had both denied involvement in the case of the diplomat.</p>
<p>The Berne federal prosecutor's office said the diplomat had confessed to espionage.</p>
<p>Constantinescu had summoned Talpes to submit a full report on the Swiss spy case, the presidency statement said. &quot;The SIE has not and is not spying on Switzerland,&quot; it said, quoting excerpts from an SIE report.</p>
<p>But the report admitted that &quot;there were sporadic contacts over several years between a Swiss diplomat and SIE collaborators&quot;.</p>
<p>It did not name the Swiss diplomat but said he had &quot;offered unclassified documents, which were not detrimental to Switzerland's interests or security.&quot;</p>
<p>Last week, Berne prosecutors said they took a Swiss diplomat into custody over accusations he handed secret political and economic data to Romanian intelligence, as well as information about people wanted by police.</p>
<p>Talpes offered to quit &quot;considering that this case might compromise Romanian-Swiss relations and because I deem myself the sole person responsible for this situation&quot;, the presidency quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>The statement quoted Constantinescu as saying the SIE chief's resignation was &quot;in keeping with the code of military honour&quot;.</p>
<p>Constantinescu has yet to appoint a successor to Talpes, the second major spymaster to quit this year.</p>
<p>The head of the SRI, Virgil Magureanu, quit earlier this year after serving since the body's inception in March 1990 to replace Romania's dreaded Communist-era secret police, the Securitate.</p>
<p>Constantinescu and centrists who ended seven years of leftist administration in last November's elections have vowed to bring the Balkan country's intelligence community under full democratic control.</p>
<p>The United States and the European Union have encouraged Romania's leadership to rid the country of remnants of the Securitate believed to have remained in top intelligence posts.</p>
<p>The SRI is the only intelligence body subject to parliamentary control out of a dozen intelligence units operating in Romania since the 1989 fall of communism.</p>
<p>A top SRI official was removed this week, within days of being appointed to head operations in western Romania, after Romanian newspapers linked him to Securitate excesses.</p>
<p>The Swiss diplomat's arrest followed an embarrassing incident last year when Berne recalled its ambassador to Romania for an inquiry into accusations that his Romanian lover was a spy.</p>
