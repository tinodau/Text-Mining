<headline>Major stock movements overnight - Feb 3.</headline>
<text>
<p>NEW YORK - U.S. stocks ended mixed on profit-taking on Friday but bond prices jumped -- sending interest rates lower -- after the government reported a surge in economic growth but little inflation at the end of last year.</p>
<p>In the stock market, investors took profits in high-flying blue chips and shifted funds into small companies, boosting the lagging Nasdaq market.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 10.77 points to 6,813.09 after racking up two straight days of gains. For the week, the index was up 116.61 points.  </p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.83 points to 1,379.85, ending up 16.01 points for the week.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,380 to 1,098 on heavy volume of 574 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE 100 share index burst into record territory as signs that the Dow's bull run was back on track inspired British shares to bound ahead. The FTSE closed at an all time high of 4,275.8, up 47.4 points on the day and 57 points since the start of the week.  </p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Strong results from software firm SAP AG and further gains on Wall Street spurred the German share market to new records. The 30-share DAX index ended floor trade at a record close of 3,035.15 points, a rise of 17.83 points on the day and 36.91 since last Friday. Later, the IBIS DAX ended the late electronic trading session up 19.05 points, also at a record of 3,037.70.</p>
<p>PARIS - Shares set a closing record, finishing up 0.54 percent, boosted by a rise on Wall Street and U.S. growth data which lowered inflation concern in the United States. The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 13.50 points at 2,516.56 but off an all-time intra day high of 2,521.88. This week the CAC-40 gained 86.22 points.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Shares shot to new highs, extending recent gains, as a four percent jump in index heavyweight Roche drove the blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) to a record close. The SMI closed up 63.1 points, or 1.5 percent, at 4,272.2, after setting an all-time high of 4,272.4 during the session. The broad SPI gained 38.95 points to close at the day's high of 2,728.33 which was also a record close and a gain of 88.86 on the week.  </p>
<p>TOKYO - Stocks bounced back sharply, turning around the previous day's decline of over 2.5 percent. Massive short-covering was triggered by a comment by U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan that Japan is overly pessimistic about its economy. The benchmark Nikkei average of 225 leading shares ended up 465.97 points at 18,330.01, a rise of 640.65 on the week.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Strength in banking and utility stocks allowed Hong Kong stocks to end with modest gains but the market's recent soft tone kept investors cautious and analysts said interest rates still remained a concern. The Hang Seng Index rose 33.39 points to 13,321.79. Over the week it shed 57.76 points or 0.43 percent.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - A mixed share market muddled its way to a firmer close as Dow-inspired strength in the industrials managed to overcome a resources sector weakened by soft precious and base metals prices. Option exercises following Thursday's January series expiry inflated otherwise modest turnovers. The All Ordinaries index added 6.0 points to 2,423.7, a slight rise of 0.7 from last Friday.  </p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - Industrial shares shunned Wall Street's rich overnight gains to trade weaker during the morning before being pulled higher by futures trade to finish strong. Industrials finished the day 40.7 points higher at 8,003.3, down 39.5 on the week. The all-share index closed 17.9 points higher at 6,676.1 a loss of 8.5 since last Friday. Gold shares struggled throughout the day to stifle their fall on the back of dull bullion. The gold index finished 15.3 points lower at 1,350.0 down 20.4 from last weeks close.</p>
