<p>Volkswagen on Wednesday rejected a demand by rival carmaker Opel, the German unit of U.S. car giant General Motors, that a top VW executive at the centre of industrial espionage charges be sacked.</p>
<p>Opel said the man, production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, would have to be dismissed before it would consider an out-of-court settlement of the dispute.</p>
<p>But a VW spokesman rejected the demand as being unacceptable and said any talks over a deal in the U.S. lawsuit filed by Opel and General Motors against Volkswagen would require no preconditions.</p>
<p>Opel's demand that Lopez be fired came after a U.S. judge in Detroit, the hometown of GM, decided to allow the carmaker to pursue racketeering charges against the executive and other VW bosses, including management board chairman Ferdinand Piech.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no dismissal of Mr. Lopez,&quot; VW spokesman Klaus Kocks told Reuters. He added, &quot;Where there is no damage, there can be no compensation.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. court decision pushed shares in VW -- Europe's largest carmaker -- down almost six percent on Wednesday. VW shares ended the bourse session at 601.25 marks. They had closed on Tuesday at 639 marks.</p>
<p>Opel dismissed speculation that it was already in talks with VW to reach a deal on the lawsuit. It not only demanded that Lopez go before relations could be improved, but also reiterated other demands first laid out in August 1993 after Lopez left GM for VW. These include a public apology by top VW executives and an unspecified payment for damages.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than take these necessary steps, Volkswagen management has continued to deny any wrongdoing and has supported Lopez by retaining him as a senior member of management,&quot; the Ruesselsheim-based carmaker said.</p>
<p>Opel made the announcement after Germany's Spiegel magazine at the weekend said the carmakers were in talks to settle the lawsuit linked to Lopez and other former Opel executives now at VW, who allegedly stole secret documents before they left.</p>
<p>Spiegel said VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen and GM executive committeee chairman John Smale had recently met in Detroit to consider a possible out-of-court settlement.</p>
<p>Opel said it was not its policy to comment on the status of confidential talks but felt obliged &quot;to correct misleading information that has been disseminated to the public&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;There are currently no settlement negotiations in progress between Opel and General Motors and Volkswagen,&quot; Opel said.</p>
