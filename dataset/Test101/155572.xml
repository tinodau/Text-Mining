<p>German shares opened floor trade higher on Wednesday, encouraged by firmer German bonds and a stronger Dow Jones index close above the crucial 6,000 point level.</p>
<p>But dealers the market was nervous ahead of a barrage of data due out of the U.S. this week. They said the DAX index of 30 leading shares was unlikely to push above the crucial 2,700 point level and would probably trade in a fairly narrow range.</p>
<p>&quot;The DAX should trade in a range between 2,670 and 2,695 today,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Traders said the last few days, when the DAX index had traded between 2,670 and just over 2,700 points, had shown that both upside and downside potential of the market were limited, at least in the short run.</p>
<p>In early trade, the DAX index was up 16.65 points, or 0.62 percent, at 2,690.27 points.</p>
<p>Overnight the U.S. Dow Jones index ended 34.29 points firmer at 6,007.02.</p>
<p>The most heavily traded DAX stock was German's largest commercial bank, Deutsche Bank, which rose 77 pfennigs to 71.13 marks, after itw suit against Opel, a unit of U.S. firm General Motors. VW shares rose 10 marks, or 1.7 percent, to 600 marks.</p>
<p>VW had charged in the lawsuit that GM and Opel had made prejudicial statements in the public that portrayed it as a criminal organisation.</p>
<p>VW had sought 10 million marks in the suit, which was the latest twist in the ongoing legal battle between the two carmakers over charges top GM officials left for VW in 1993 and brought along trade secrets.</p>
<p>VW, Europe's largest carmaker, has denied the charges brought by GM in a U.S. lawsuit.</p>
