<headline>Yeltsin demands action as foreign espionage rises.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-02-04</dateline>

<p>President Boris Yeltsin said on Tuesday Russia must defend its state interests better after hearing a report from his counter-intelligence chief saying foreign spying had increased significantly.</p>
<p>Nikolai Kovalyov, head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), told Yeltsin that 11 foreign spies had been uncovered in the last six months and 32 Russians had been caught in the same period trying to hand over secret information.</p>
<p>&quot;Information was presented bearing witness to a significant rise in the activities of foreign special services on Russian territory,&quot; presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;The president pointed to the need to improve the mechanisms for defending Russia's state interests.&quot;</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky gave no others details.</p>
<p>Moscow's security services have said several times in recent years that foreign intelligence networks are still operating against Russia despite the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p>Washington says Moscow is still active as well.</p>
<p>An official at the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said last week it was still investigating about 200 espionage cases and that resources spent on catching spies in Washington had increased since the Soviet Union's collapse.</p>
<p>In November, the FBI arrested Harold Nicholson, the highest-ranking Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer indicted so far on espionage charges. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of spying for Russia since mid-1994.</p>
<p>The FBI arrested another of its own agents, Earl Edwin Pitts, the following month for allegedly selling U.S. security secrets to Russia since 1987. Pitts denies the charge.</p>
<p>Britain and Russia expelled four diplomats each last year in a spying row.</p>
