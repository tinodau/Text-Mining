<p>Russia said on Tuesday the arrest of a former CIA station chief on charges of selling secrets to Moscow was an internal U.S. matter and refused to comment.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no comment to make on this matter,&quot; foreign ministry spokesman Mikhail Demurin told a regular news briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;An American citizen has been arrested by the U.S. authorities. It is an internal affair of that country and we have nothing to do with it,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Washington said on Monday it had arrested an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for selling secrets to Russia for at least two years, including compromising information about U.S. spies about to be sent abroad.</p>
<p>The suspect, Harold Nicholson, a 16-year CIA veteran who had been chief of station in Romania and deputy chief in Malaysia, was charged with spying for Moscow since June 1994 in exchange for more than $100,000 in cash.</p>
<p>In a separate espionage incident last week, Moscow angrily threatened retaliatory measures against the United States over its detention of a former Soviet KGB spy, Vladimir Galkin.</p>
<p>Galkin, who had given full details of his previous employment on his visa application, was arrested on October 29 and accused of trying to obtain secret information on the Star Wars programme in 1991.</p>
<p>Washington later released him after the personal intervention of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>Russia said the United States had violated an unwritten international code allowing retired agents to travel freely.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, in a graphic reminder that espionage is flourishing despite the end of the Cold War, a Russian official accused of spying for Britain prompted a tit-for-tat expulsion row in which London and Moscow each expelled four diplomats.</p>
