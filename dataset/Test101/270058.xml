<p>A U.S. federal grand jury has indicted FBI agent Earl Edwin Pitts on 12 counts of spying for Russia and related crimes, the Justice Department said on Friday.</p>
<p>The indictment by the grand jury meeting in Alexandria, Virginia, was returned and announced on Thursday, and details were released on Friday. Pitts, 43, was arrested on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The indictment charged Pitts, a 13-year FBI veteran, with conspiracy to commit espionage, attempted espionage, communication of classified information without authority and conveyance without authority of U.S. property.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, Pitts allegedly began providing counterintelligence information to the Soviet Union's intelligence service, the KGB, in 1987 while he was assigned to the FBI's New York office.</p>
<p>The indictment alleged that Pitts provided a wide range of sensitive, classified information to the KGB and its Russian successor organisation and received substantial sums of money in return.</p>
<p>It alleged he continued his activities after he was assigned to the Washington FBI office in 1989 and engaged in attempted espionage and other crimes until his arrest.</p>
<p>If convicted, Pitts faces a maximum penalty of life in prison on the espionage conspiracy and each of the attempted espionage charges, 10 to 15 years in prison on each of the other charges and a $250,000 fine on each count of the indictment.</p>
<p>Pitts is scheduled to appear in federal court on Monday for a detention hearing and for arraignment on Dec. 30.</p>
<p>Pitts' lawyer Nina Ginsberg said Thursday: &quot;He is innocent and is going to enter a plea of not guilty.&quot; She said she would seek to have Pitts released on bail.</p>
