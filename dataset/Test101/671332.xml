<p>The lawyer for an Egyptian man charged with espionage said on Wednesday his client was forced to confess to spying for Israel and that the prosecution did not have any solid evidence to convict him.</p>
<p>Emad Abdelhalim Ismail and Israeli textile engineer Azam Azam are charged with making a criminal arrangement to spy in Egypt for the Israeli secret service Mossad. Two women -- Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna -- are being tried for the same charges but in absentia.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Hisham Badawi berated Ismail before the court for betraying his country and said investigations had unearthed a handwritten statement by Ismail saying he was willing to cooperate with Israeli intelligence.</p>
<p>&quot;I Emad Abdelhamid Ismail want to live in Israel and am willing to cooperate with Israeli intelligence, and in light of the respect and freedom given to me by Israel, I am more than willing to sacrifice all I own for its people,&quot; said Badawi, reading out the statement to the courtroom.</p>
<p>&quot;You promised that you would sacrifice everything and now you have and we call for you to be punished,&quot; Badawi told Ismail, who looked on belligerently from the courtroom cage.</p>
<p>But Ahmed Bakr, Ismail's lawyer, told reporters the prosecution did not have any proof that Ismail was recruited by Mossad and that he was probably duped into confessing.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the job of the prosecution to convict, they're not going to tell you they tricked him into confessing, telling him he was a witness and not a defendant,&quot; Bakr said.</p>
<p>&quot;And there are many types of confessions like those made under duress. I think this was one of them,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Both Azam and Ismail face at least 15 years in jail if convicted. The trial, which began on April 24, has brought Egyptian-Israeli relations to one of their lowest points since both countries signed a peace treaty in 1979.</p>
<p>Bakr asked the judges to acquit his young Egyptian client, who wept copiously during the session, because he told police at least four times he thought he was being drawn into an Israeli spy ring. The case was adjourned until July 19.</p>
<p>&quot;My client is a naive village boy who was deceived by people who took advantage of his lack of exposure to the world but at least his sense of nationalism saved him at the end,&quot; Bakr told the courtroom during his 2-1/2 hour address.</p>
<p>&quot;The law does not acquit someone for being an idiot but my client felt there was something dangerous going on and went and told the police before they began investigations. Under the law, this is ground for acquittal.</p>
<p>&quot;Emad was telling the police: 'Help me, I'm being dragged into the spy ring' but their response was slow,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>According to the investigations, Azam allegedly gave Ismail ladies underwear impregnated with Mossad's invisible ink to carry into Egypt.</p>
<p>Published accounts of Ismail's confession show he was blackmailed into working for Mossad by explicit pictures of his love affair with Greiss and that Shawahnah offered him $1,000 to work for Israeli intelligence.</p>
<p>Bakr said there was no proof that Ismail was offered money and that there was no evidence that he knew about the secret ink in the underwear or that he even used it. Farid el-Deeb, Azam's lawyer, wants more tests run on the underwear.</p>
