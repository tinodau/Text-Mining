<p>An Israeli textile worker went on trial in Cairo on Thursday on charges of spying for the Jewish state and damaging Egypt's national interests.</p>
<p>Azam Azam, a 35-year-old chief mechanic, and alleged Egyptian accomplice Emad Abdelhamid Ismail could face 15 years in jail with hard labour if convicted.</p>
<p>At the start of the session, Azam and Ismail both told the judge they were not guilty. On arrival Azam had told reporters: &quot;By God Almighty, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.&quot;</p>
<p>Azam's lawyer, Farid el-Deeb, said the charge sheet referred only to economic espionage and the maximum penalty was 15 years, compared with life imprisonment for other forms of spying.</p>
<p>He said Azam and Ismail were accused of trying to obtain information about Egyptian factories such as those in the industrial satellite city of 10th of Ramadan City.</p>
<p>The Egyptian state has never said what kind of information they think Azam was seeking but they have have said the Israeli intelligence service Mossad was behind him.</p>
<p>Israeli embassy first secretary David Govrin said he thought the trial would be fair and the court would acquit Azam.</p>
<p>&quot;We are sure he is innocent and hope that the court will come to this conclusion as soon as possible,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Asaad Asaad, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a former Knesset member, said: &quot;I personally and Azam's family and most of the Israeli people trust the Egyptian legal system and its fairness.&quot;</p>
<p>Asaad, like Azam a member of Israel's small Druze community, is attending the trial as an observer.</p>
<p>Netanyahu had asked President Hosni Mubarak to set Azam free but Mubarak said he could not interfere with the judiciary.</p>
<p>Azam, who was working at an Israeli textile factory in a north Cairo suburb at the time of his arrest last November, went on trial at the South Cairo Supreme State Security Court.</p>
<p>Govrin said the case had already damaged economic relations between Egypt and the Jewish state. &quot;After he was arrested, the textile factory was closed. Of course Israeli businessmen are not encouraged, to say the least, to invest here due to the fact that they might be arrested,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Other defendants in the espionage case are Ismail, 34, and two Israeli women who are not in Egypt -- Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say that Ismail agreed to help the two women spy for Mossad when he went to Israel in 1996 to train at a women's garment factory.</p>
<p>Greiss, with whom the prosecution said Ismail was having an affair, gave the Egyptian $650 when he was recruited and Shawahna offered to pay him $1,000 a month if he helped Mossad, according to the charge sheet.</p>
<p>Azam's alleged role in the espionage case was to deliver to Ismail women's underwear inscribed with invisible ink.</p>
