<headline>Lopez lawyer - charges assert no wrongdoing to GM.</headline>

<p>Lawyers for former Volkswagen AG purchasing executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua said on Wednesday that German criminal charges did not assert that General Motors Corp was damaged through alleged industrial espionage when Lopez quit GM to join VW in 1993.</p>
<p>The lawyers, Juergen Taschke and Eberhard Wahle, confirmed the charges had been filed against Lopez, noting that the charges by the Darmstadt public prosecutors' office showed &quot;sufficient suspicion&quot; that secret GM documents were taken.</p>
<p>But the lawyers said in a statement the German charges do not assert any relevant damage to GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG, by Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, and they claimed the documents in question were not confidential.  </p>
<p>The statement by the lawyers also said GM's accusations against Lopez that he stole plans for a new super-efficient factory were unfounded. They also criticised prosecutors for not noting that the factory was also being planned with a Spanish consortium.</p>
<p>&quot;The prosecutors themselves have stated that it only involved a very preliminary study for a factory that would have required extensive additional work to be completed,&quot; the lawyers said in the statement.</p>
<p>In addition, they said the prosecutors' charges did not confirm GM's accusation of collusion between Lopez and top VW executives.</p>
<p>GM said on Wednesday that charges were filed against former VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, former VW executive Jose Manuel Gutierrez, current VW employee Rosario Piazza and Jorge Alvarez, now at VW subsidiary SEAT in Spain.</p>
<p>Lopez and Gutierrez, who was an executive director in charge of purchasing at GM before joining VW, both resigned from VW after Lopez's lawyers said they expected prosecutors to file the charges by year-end.</p>
<p>Lopez led a group of seven workers who followed him to VW and allegedly brought along thousands of secret documents on parts pricing and plans for a new super-efficient factory, which GM alleges was the model for a new VW plant in Brazil.</p>
