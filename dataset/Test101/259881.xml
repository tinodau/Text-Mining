<headline>VW head sought Ford help in GM row -magazine.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-12-16</dateline>

<p>Volkswagen AG chairman Ferdinand Piech has asked a top Ford Motor Corp executive to help mediate its legal fight with General Motors Corp, Germany's Manager Magazine said on Monday.</p>
<p>The magazine said Piech had invited the head of Ford's worldwide automotive operations, Jacques Nasser, to a dinner meeting in Germany that was held in early December.</p>
<p>The two executives discussed ways to reach an out-of-court settlement of GM's allegations in a U.S. lawsuit that former GM executives left the U.S. carmaker and brought along secret documents to VW in 1993, according to the report.</p>
<p>Volkswagen declined immediate comment on the report.</p>
<p>The magazine said VW was considering offering to buy 100 million marks worth of cable trees and batteries from GM as part of an effort to convince the Detroit carmaker to drop its legal action against the German carmaker.</p>
<p>The magazine said VW board member Klaus Liesen had sought other intermediaries in the dispute with GM, including former German economics minister Otto Count Lambsdorff. But the magazine said the efforts had failed.</p>
<p>At the centre of the fight between GM and VW is Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua who GM alleges stole secret documents when he left the American car maker to join VW.</p>
<p>A German court on Friday said it was filing charges against Lopez and three others for embezzlement and betrayal of corporate secrets.</p>
<p>In addition to those charges, Lopez faces a grand jury investigation by prosecutors in Detroit -- proceedings VW hopes to avoid by reaching an out-of-court settlement.</p>
<p>GM is expected to demand billions of dollars in damages in a jury trial from VW since GM claims Lopez used its documents at VW to cut costs by more than a billion marks.</p>
<p>Previous attempts to settle the U.S. lawsuit have failed because VW has rejected GM's conditions which are that it sever ties with Lopez, admit wrongdoing and pay damages.</p>
