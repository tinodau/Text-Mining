<p>The financial services unit of German carmaker Volkswagen AG said on Wednesday its 1996 net income rose 60 percent to 266 million marks on the back of a 12 percent surge in the number of new financing agreements.</p>
<p>The VW unit said it transferred 55.4 million marks of the profit to Volkswagen, which is the unit's sole shareholder.</p>
<p>VW said the financial services unit entered into nearly 840,000 financing and leasing agreements in 1996 compared with 750,000 in 1995 and accounted for nearly every third vehicle sold by the Volkswagen group in western Europe last year.</p>
<p>VW's German financial services unit again posted the highest business volumes in 1996 and accounted for 72 percent of all existing finance and lease contracts and 578,000 of the new contracts signed.</p>
<p>At the end of 1996, VW said its customer finance lending portfolio held by the unit had grown by 11 percent to a new record level of 1.2 million agreements in Europe.</p>
<p>Volkswagen said it expected the unit &quot;to again record good results&quot; for 1997 based on what it said were positive economic forecasts reported for almost all of the countries where the financial services unit operates.</p>
<p>The VW unit's management board chairman, Norbert Massfeller, said VW would keep up its international expansion in new European markets and also in Asia. VW in January started a new leasing company in Poland in January and plans for a new bank in the country.</p>
<p>In addition, VW said the financial services unit would offer a nominal 20 billion yen Samurai bond at the end of March through its Dutch subsidiary.</p>
