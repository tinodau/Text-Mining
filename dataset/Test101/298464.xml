<p>A U.S. lawyer representing former Volkswagen AG purchasing chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua said Friday he hopes the settlement between VW and General Motors Corp will help quell the U.S. criminal investigation of Lopez.</p>
<p>&quot;It is my hope that this settlement will dampen the ardor of the criminal investigation,&quot; attorney Plato Cacheris said. &quot;It's a factor that the U.S. Justice Department should consider.&quot;  </p>
<p>Cacheris, based in Washington, D.C., said it was a significant step that GM and VW could settle their differences.</p>
<p>The two automakers announced Thursday that they had settled their four-year-dispute, dismissing GM's federal racketeering lawsuit against VW, which accused Lopez and others of conspiring to steal corporate secrets when they quit GM to join VW in 1993.</p>
<p>VW agreed to pay GM $100 million and committed to boosting its purchases of GM parts by $1 billion over seven years. Both sides exchanged letters expressing &quot;regret&quot; about certain actions and statements.</p>
<p>German prosecutors brought criminal charges against Lopez and three others in December.  The U.S. Justice Department's investigation is continuing.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Detroit was not immediately available for comment on the civil settlement.</p>
