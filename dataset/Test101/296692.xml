<p>Volkswagen AG's supervisory board has agreed in principle to settle a nearly four-year-old dispute with General Motors Corp over allegations of industrial spying, VW board sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>But it has not yet finalised a deal with the U.S. car giant, the supervisory board sources said.</p>
<p>The German car maker's board met for about an hour on Thursday and discussed specific proposals to end the dispute over allegations that former VW production guru Jose Ignacio Lopez stole secrets when he quit GM, according to sources in the Lower Saxony state government, which owns 20 percent of VW.</p>
<p>Secret talks between VW and GM, which have centred on VW agreeing to retract statements made about GM and its German subsidiary, Adam Opel AG, have not yet been completed.</p>
<p>But sources for both car makers said an out-of-court deal between VW and its biggest rival in Europe could be announced as soon as Friday with both sides apparently wanting to end the dispute without harming brand images or market position by a lengthy fight.</p>
<p>One source close to the talks said there had been &quot;real progress in settlement discussions&quot; since VW was now prepared to publicly retract statements that GM and Adam Opel might have manipulated or falsified evidence later collected by German prosecutors.</p>
<p>The Wolfsburg-based car maker has also apparently agreed to retract suggestions by top VW officials that GM had organised an attack against Germany as an economic centre.</p>
<p>&quot;This has prepared the basis to go further,&quot; the source said. &quot;You can assume the talks are ongoing and are intensive.&quot;</p>
<p>Previous attempts to end the dispute have failed because VW had refused to retract the statements, according to GM sources.</p>
<p>Both car makers declined official comment on the talks.</p>
<p>But, after months of heated exchanges, they made conciliatory noises on Thursday as speculation about a possible deal sent VW shares surging in Frankfurt bourse dealings. VW shares ended up 27 marks at 706.90, a record high.</p>
<p>Hans Wilhelm Gaeb, a vice president at GM's European headquarters in Zurich, said GM was committed to being a &quot;fair player&quot; with VW and reiterated that its dispute targeted a handful of VW officials, not the company itself.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always made clear that we have respect for VW. We have not wanted to damage VW as a firm. We had to take the legal action in Detroit to get this issue moved,&quot; Gaeb said.</p>
<p>VW spokesman Klaus Kocks, who once said he loved to get the blood pressure boiling at GM, welcomed Gaeb's comments.</p>
<p>The two car makers began new talks in early January to end the dispute, which is centred on a Detroit federal court lawsuit in which GM charged VW and some top executives with racketeering for luring away Lopez in March 1993.</p>
<p>GM charges in the lawsuit, which names VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech as a defendant, that Lopez stole thousands of GM documents on a new factory, parts data and cost data for existing GM vehicles and also those under development.</p>
<p>Lopez quit the VW management board in late November, a condition set by GM for any settlement talks, shortly before German prosecutors filed criminal charges against him and three other executives accused of bringing the documents to VW.</p>
<p>But German prosecutors said they found insufficient evidence of a conspiracy between senior VW managers and Lopez, who could face up to five years in prison if he were convicted.</p>
<p>VW has been under intense pressure to settle the dispute since GM was expected to demand damages of billions of dollars because it claimed Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, used the data to cut one billion marks in costs at VW.</p>
<p>A U.S. lawsuit award by a jury would then be tripled under a U.S. racketeering law first used to fight organised crime, which has prompted some German leaders to call on VW to end the fight and kept the car maker's share price under pressure.</p>
<p>The source said GM was still committed to receiving damages, calling it a matter of principle. But the source added: &quot;The amount to be claimed is subject to the atmosphere of the discussions and that the other conditions be met.&quot;</p>
<p>Sources have said any damages to GM might include a deal for VW to cooperate on joint ventures in emerging markets, such as China, where VW is strong, or for VW to buy car parts from GM.</p>
