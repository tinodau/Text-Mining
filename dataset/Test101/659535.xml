<title>USA: US woman to remain in custody on spy charges.</title>

<p>A former U.S. Army clerk, charged with spying for Hungary and Czechoslovakia during the Cold War, will have to remain in federal custody until her trial, a U.S. magistrate ruled on Friday.</p>
<p>U.S. Magistrate Claude Hicks declared Kelly Therese Warren an escape risk and, calling espionage the most serious federal crime, ordered her to remain in custody. Warren, 31, had asked Hicks through her attorney to set bond so that she could return home to nearby Warner Robins, Georgia.</p>
<p>The decision means Warren will be transferred from the Macon County jail to a federal facility in Tampa, Florida, U.S. officials said. She was expected to be tried in U.S. District Court in Tampa this year.</p>
<p>Warren was the fifth person to be charged with taking part in a spy ring that passed secret U.S. and NATO defence plans to Hungary and Czechoslovakia in the mid-1980s.</p>
<p>She served in the 8th Infantry Division headquarters at Bad Kreuznach, in what was then West Germany, from 1986 to 1988. She worked in the administration of the G-3 Section, where her duties included preparing classified documents for publication and distribution, a federal indictment said.</p>
<p>G-3 was responsible for planning and training the 8th Infantry for the defence of Western Europe in the event of attack from Warsaw Pact countries. Federal prosecutors claim Warren passed documents on to espionage ringleader Sgt. 1st Class Clyde Lee Conrad, who gave them to communist agents.</p>
<p>Conrad was convicted of high treason in Germany in 1990 and sentenced to life in prison, the stiffest sentence given for espionage by a German court since the Second World War.</p>
<p>&quot;On 50 or more occasions she passed highly classified documents to Conrad,&quot; assistant U.S. Attorney Walter Furr told the magistrate on Friday. &quot;She paid off bills. When she got out of the Army, she took and blew the money she'd made off of espionage (by) partying.&quot;</p>
<p>Warren has been married twice, has a 10-year-old daughter and had been living in a mobile home. Until her arrest on Tuesday, she worked in the parts department of a mobile home sales store on the outskirts of Warner Robins Air Force Base.</p>
