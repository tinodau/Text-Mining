<p>HANOVER, Germany, Nov 29 - German carmaker Volkswagen AG denied a radio report on Friday that its production chief at the centre of a lgal battle with U.S. giant General Motors had offered to resign.</p>
<p>A report on north German radio said Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, at the centre of the three-year legal battle with GM, had offered to resign at VW'se supervisory board meeting, which started at 0800 GMT on Friday.</p>
<p>The company said the its supervisory board would make a statement if it reached a decision at the meeting.</p>
<p>VW spokesman Klaus Kocks denied the radio report, saying: &quot;That cannot be, they have not discussed the matter yet.&quot;</p>
<p>VW has so far declined comment on media reports that Lopez, accused by his former employer GM of stealing secret documents on purchasing and car production plans when he moved to VW in March 1993, was likely to offer his resignation, and the board was likely to accept it.</p>
<p>&quot;If the supervisory board reaches a decision that would require a statement, it will make a statement,&quot; Kocks said.</p>
<p>VW had earlier scheduled a news conference for 1530 GMT on Friday, after the board meeting ends, about its activities at the Expo 2000 world exhibition in Hanover.</p>
<p>The supervisory board is due to reach a decision on those activities at Friday's meeting.</p>
<p>But the news conference looks set to be dominated by media questions about the future of Lopez, a Spaniard renowned for his cost-cutting abilities, who VW after it reported a one billion mark loss. He is credited with helping returning VW to profitability since.</p>
<p>Otto Ferdinand Wachs, an executive overseeing VW's activities at Expo 2000, and Robert Buechelhofer, a member of Expo 2000's supervisory board, are scheduled to hold the news conference.</p>
<p>VW on Wednesday rejected a demand by GM's German subsidiary Adam Opel AG to fire Lopez, apologise publicly and pay compensation in return for an out-of-court settlement in a U.S. civil lawsuit filed by Opel and GM.</p>
<p>Pressure on VW to reach a settlement mounted this week after a U.S. judge in Detroit, GM's home town, ruled GM could pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and other VW executives, including VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech.</p>
<p>The decision trebles the amount of compensation VW would have to pay if found guilty and could confront the carmaker with a bill totalling billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, sources close to Opel on Friday said Lopez's departure on its own would not suffice to bring about an out-of-court deal.</p>
<p>&quot;Lopez stepping down would only be a symbolic move, a long-overdue decision which will have come too late,&quot; one Opel source said.</p>
