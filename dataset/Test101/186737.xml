<title>GERMANY: VW celebrates 17 millionth Golf.</title>
<headline>VW celebrates 17 millionth Golf.</headline>
<dateline>WOLFSBURG, Germany 1996-11-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Volkswagen AG, under fire in its court battle against rival Adam Opel AG and from a new company book detailing its Nazi past, had something to celebrate on Wednesday -- production of its 17 millionth Golf.</p>
<p>The German carmaker said it took only 15 months for one million of the popular Golfs, the top selling car in Europe, to be produced since the 16 millionth car rolled off an assembly line on July 4, 1995.</p>
<p>The record-setting car that was produced on Wednesday was a four-door Golf DTI in bright red that has been marked for export, VW said in a statement.</p>
<p>The ceremony was a welcome relief for VW, which has been suffering from a series of public relations setbacks and is in a court battle with Opel and its parent General Motors Corp over industrial espionage charges.</p>
<p>In addition, a new book published last week detailed the company's Nazi roots, prompting a top VW official to warn other carmakers not to use the book against it in advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>Production of the Golf began in April 1974 and daily worldwide production now stands at 3,640 vehicles. The most are made at VW's main plant in Wolfsburg, while others are made in Brussels, Osnabrueck and Mosel, Germany, Mexico, South Africa and Slovakia, VW said.</p>
<p>Of the 17 million Golfs that have so far been made, VW said 39 percent, or 6.6 million vehicles, were delivered in Germany, while 61 percent, or 10.4 million vehicles, were exported.</p>
<p>VW said the top export markets for the Golf are the U.S., which has received 1.87 million vehicles, Italy with 1.51 million vehicles, France with 1.27 million vehicles and the U.K. with 735,000.</p>
<p>Other top markets include Mexico with 588,000 vehicles, the Netherlands with 514,000, Austria with 513,000, Belgium with 462,000, South Africa with 419,000 and Switzerland with 400,000, VW said.</p>
