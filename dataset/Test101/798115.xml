<headline>More than 20 missing after Hanoi ferry disaster.</headline>

<p>A crowded ferry collided with barges and overturned outside Hanoi throwing dozens of people into the water and killing at least four, a city official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>More than 20 passengers were missing.</p>
<p>The official, who declined to be identified, said the ferry struck the barges on Monday night as it was attempting to pass them in a narrow channel on the Red River just north of the city.</p>
<p>It capsized immediately spilling people and cargo into the river. By Wednesday morning 73 people had been rescued. More than 20 families had reported members still missing.</p>
<p>The accident was not reported by state media on Monday or Tuesday for reasons which were not clear.</p>
<p>Survivors were quoted by local newspapers on Wednesday as saying the ferry captain and crew had shouted warnings to the barge operators, who failed to respond.</p>
<p>Some passengers tried to stop the collision by fending off the vessels by hand. They were tossed into the river as the force of the barges overturned the ferry.</p>
<p>The area of the accident, close to a major Soviet-built Bridge, was the scene of another ferry disaster three years ago in which 28 people died.</p>
<p>The official said efforts to recover bodies were continuing, but it was likely to take several days before all were found because of fast-moving currents which were likely to have swept people downstream.</p>
<p>Police said nine people, all members of the barge crew, had been arrested.</p>
