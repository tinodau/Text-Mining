<p>German prosecutors, ending a 3-1/2 year probe, said on Friday criminal charges have been filed against four former General Motors Corp executives who they allege stole secret documents when they left GM in 1993 to join Volkswagen AG.</p>
<p>But prosecutors said they found no evidence VW executives colluded in the transfer of secrets -- contrary to allegations made by GM -- even though they said some of the data was used by the former GM workers in presentations to VW executives.</p>
<p>Charges were filed against former VW production executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and three other former GM employees identified as Jose Manuel Gutierrez, Rosario Piazza and Jorge Alavarez, who followed Lopez to VW in March 1993.</p>
<p>&quot;The aim of obtaining these documents was to use them in the interest of VW after the transfer there,&quot; said Gerhard Andres, chief prosecutor at the Darmstadt prosecutors' office.</p>
<p>Lopez and the others, if convicted, could face up to five years in prison or a fine. But legal experts say first-time offenders for such an offence do not usually face prison terms.</p>
<p>The four were officially charged on December 6 under allegations of embezzlement and betrayal of corporate secrets. The charges must now be approved by a court which will determine whether the evidence supports the allegations. Prosecutors declined to predict when a trial could begin.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the 55-year-old Lopez, who is believed to be now living in Spain after he resigned from the VW management board in late November, and the others will remain free.</p>
<p>Gutierrez, a Spaniard, resigned his position as a top VW production executive in November, but Piazza, an Italian, and Alvarez, the son of a Spanish industrialist, are still working in Spain for VW or for consulting groups tied to VW.</p>
<p>Andres said more than 20,000 documents and computer diskettes with millions of pages of data were taken, including plans for a factory called &quot;Plant X&quot; in Spain, pricing data for European cars and cost data on GM vehicles as well as documents for a new car being developed by GM called the &quot;O-Car.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the 60-page indictment alleges Lopez began forming plans to obtain secret GM and Opel documents after meeting with VW management board member Ferdinand Piech on November 29, 1993, to discuss his joining the Wolfsburg-based carmaker.</p>
<p>Lopez then approached Gutierrez, Piazza and Alvarez about following him to Volkswagen and they allegedly began collecting secret GM data on research, planning and purchasing for new factories as well as top-selling GM cars under development before they left for GM in March 1993, Andres said.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Lopez said in a statement after the charges were announced that they were based on statements from GM officials and circumstantial evidence. They also said many documents in question had been handed out to suppliers at GM meetings or were completed in conjunction with a Spanish consortium studying the factory.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the charges did not measure the amount of damage GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG, suffered because that task was not part of their probe.</p>
<p>Andres also clearly stated that prosecutors in the course of their investigation had found no evidence that VW staff had colluded with Lopez in the theft of documents.</p>
<p>&quot;I say with all clarity that we always kept an eye on this suspicion,&quot; Andres told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;But the investigation found no sufficient indications that someone from VW in any way colluded in the alleged deeds as we have presented them here relating to Lopez and the others.&quot;</p>
<p>Volkswagen said on Friday the charges against Lopez cleared the way for fresh talks with GM to settle its U.S. racketeering lawsuit against the German carmaker since it was not implicated in the German criminal investigation.</p>
<p>Shares in Volkswagen, recently under stiff pressure, rose in bourse dealings after U.S. brokerage house Lehman Brothers raised its VW rating to &quot;outperform&quot; from &quot;neutral&quot;. VW ended bourse trade up 3.75 marks at 603.75 marks.</p>
<p>Germany's Die Welt newspaper reported on Friday that top VW and GM executives may meet next week in New York for talks, also helping to underpin VW shares while the broader 30-share DAX index fell more than 1.6 percent in active dealings.</p>
<p>But GM officials dismissed VW's call for talks, saying no secret talks were underway nor any planned and that the U.S. lawsuit had nothing to do with the German criminal probe.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no current talks and none are planned,&quot; Opel management board member Horst Borghs told Reuters.</p>
<p>The German criminal charges add to the troubles for Lopez, who also faces a U.S. grand jury investigation by prosecutors in Detroit and a German labour court hearing in Braunschweig.</p>
<p>GM is expected to demand billions of dollars of damages in a jury trial from VW since GM claims Lopez used its documents at VW to cut costs by more than a billion marks ($647.7 million) and that its cost advantages over VW were reduced.</p>
<p>Any U.S. lawsuit award by a jury could be tripled under the U.S. racketeering laws first used to fight the mafia.</p>
<p>Previous attempts to settle the U.S. lawsuit have failed because VW has rejected GM's conditions which are that it sever ties with Lopez, admit to wrongdoing and pay damages. ($1=1.5439 Mark)</p>
