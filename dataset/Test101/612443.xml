<p>A former clerk with the National Security Agency was sentenced to 18 years in prison and a $10,000 fine in federal court on Friday for selling secrets to the Soviet Union 30 years ago.</p>
<p>The sentence came in a bargain for Robert Lipka's guilty plea to selling top-secret National Security Agency documents to Soviet espionage agents.</p>
<p>The offences involved photographing the papers while Lipka, from Millersville, Pa., worked as a clerk at National Security Agency headquarters at Fort Meade, Md., from 1965 through 1967.</p>
<p>The government alleged Lipka, 51, collected $27,000 from his handlers. He was not arrested until 1996, when the FBI cited statements he had made to an unnamed witness.</p>
<p>The deal required Lipka to plead guilty to a single count of conspiring to commit espionage. It also required him to get clearance for any statements and turn over to the government any fees for his story.</p>
<p>In return, prosecutors said, top-secret documents and a sensitive witness would be shielded.</p>
