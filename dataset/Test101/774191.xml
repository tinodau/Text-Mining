<p>Volkswagen AG, the largest carmaker in  Europe, will finally join the big leagues of sports sponsorship on  Saturday when their hometown team of Wolfsburg plays its first match  in Germany's first-division Bundesliga.</p>
<p>But don't look for the VW insignia to be soon adorning the jerseys  of top-name European soccer teams -- as does the logo of many VW rivals,  notably Adam Opel AG which has major sponsorship deals with Bayern  Munich and Italy's AC Milan.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a backyard sponsorship deal that has turned out to be incredibly  productive,&quot; said Klaus Kocks, a Volkswagen management board member  in charge of corporate communications.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a way to show our commitment to Wolfsburg area but it will not  be part of our marketing strategy,&quot; Kocks said.</p>
<p>The VW logo will remain on the front of the team's green and white  jerseys at an estimated cost of three million marks, money that comes  out of VW's human resources department and not from marketing funds,  according to VW officials.</p>
<p>Despite Wolfsburg's promotion into the first division, a mega market  where sponsors offer teams millions of marks to have their logo on  jerseys, VW has put up the additional money to keep on supporting  the team as it has done for decades.</p>
<p>&quot;It would have been unthinkable for us to go into the first division  without Volkswagen as our top sponsor,&quot; said Wolfgang Heitman, managment  board chairman of the Wolfsburg club and owner of three VW dealerships  in the Wolfsburg region.</p>
<p>The Wolfsburg team suffered years of mediocrity in local leagues before  making an assault on the top league in the mid-1980s. The efforts  proved fruitful last season when the team was promoted to the first  division for the first time.</p>
<p>The German carmaker instead will stick to its strategy of sponsoring  up-and-coming music groups as well as cultural exhibits, such as the  &quot;documenta&quot; art show in Kassel, to build its image in Europe, where  it leads all other carmakers.</p>
<p>VW recently stopped sponsoring big-time rock groups such as the Rolling  Stones and Pink Floyd and offering special edition models during their  European concert tours.</p>
<p>While other carmakers seek exposure on television with their sponsorship  deals, VW appears more interested in building its support in the local  region and motivating its workforce.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a decisive step,&quot; said Peter Strahlendorf, publisher of a German  magazine on advertising and marketing.</p>
<p>&quot;VW will strengthen its position in the region and show thier strong  ties. Wolfsburg is on the way up and they can use that to their advantage,&quot;  he said. &quot;The VW brand is well known but this should help them to  be viewed as more sympathetic.&quot;</p>
<p>But VW apparently does not think such sports sponsorhip deals help  long-term sales, a position disputed by Opel, a unit of U.S. carmaker  General Motors Corp.</p>
<p>Opel spends about 45 million marks a year, or about 15 to 20 percent  of all advertising and promotional spending, to sponsor top teams  such as Bayern Munich, AC Milan, Paris-St. Germain and the French  and Irish national soccer teams.</p>
<p>Some auto industry experts see a small link between sports sponsorship  and bring people into dealerships but note that top carmakers continually  pour money into soccer.</p>
<p>Opel alone is estimated to spend about six million marks a year sponsoring  Bayern Munich, which won the Bundesliga last year, while the German  unit of Ford Motor Co spends about three million marks on its hometown  team in Cologne and Korean carmaker Hyundai spends 2.8 million marks  on Hamburger SV.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone who doubts such sponsoring doesn't work should remember that  Opel for years was viewed as a car for old people who even wore hats  inside cars,&quot; said Strahlendorf. &quot;Now it is a sportier model and their  market share has certainly risen.&quot;</p>
