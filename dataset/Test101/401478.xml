<p>Volkswagen AG, a day before it will announce a response to a growing bribery scandal, said on Tuesday that 1996 group profit doubled to 678 million marks ($405 million) on the back of a 14 percent rise in sales to 100.1 billion marks.</p>
<p>VW said profit at the group level rose to 678 million marks from 336 million marks in 1995 and earnings at the parent level rose 54 percent to 630 million marks from 410 million marks.</p>
<p>The Wolfsburg-based carmaker also proposed to its supervisory board that the dividend on 1996 results be raised to 318 million marks. The payout on ordinary shares would be raised to nine marks per share from six marks in 1995 and to 10 marks for preference shares from seven marks.</p>
<p>But the carmaker said cash flow, viewed by analysts as a more transparent look at VW's health, rose a meagre 4.4 percent to 10.85 billion marks from 10.4 billion marks in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect that they were a little light of where most people had assumed the figures would be,&quot; said John Lawson, analyst at Salomon Brothers in London.</p>
<p>Lawson warned against reading too deeply into VW's results, known to be padded with provisions, saying VW was still performing better than its industry peers.</p>
<p>&quot;This company is still doing a lot better than its peer group and that will be influential in what happens to its share price in the future,&quot; Lawson said.</p>
<p>VW did not say whether the results reflected the $100 million payment made to General Motors Corp as part of a deal reached in January to settle GM's lawsuit charging VW with industrial spying when it hired away purchasing guru Jose Ignacio Lopez in 1993 from the U.S. carmaker.</p>
<p>Stock traders were unimpressed with the results, saying the profit figures were below market expectations and that they were more concerned about allegations of some VW employees demanding and receiving bribes from industry suppliers.</p>
<p>VW shares fell as low as 795 marks in post-bourse IBIS electronic trade before ending the day down 3.25 marks at 798 marks. The 30-share DAX index, however, ended the day up 52.71 points at 3,233.34 points, a gain of 1.66 percent.</p>
<p>A VW official confirmed on Tuesday that the carmaker would issue a statement on Wednesday about the bribery allegations, which centre on the alleged payment of 20 million marks in bribes in connection with a 400 million mark plant expansion contract for VW's Czech Skoda unit.</p>
<p>Lopez, credited with helping to return VW to profitability, has been named by Germany's Der Spiegel magazine as being involved in the so-called &quot;Network&quot; that demanded five percent of a contract's value in kickbacks.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, has declined comment on the magazine's allegations.</p>
<p>VW on Monday turned over the findings of its internal probe into the allegations, which have so far led to the suspension of one worker and the firing of another who was being held in custody by prosecutors.</p>
<p>Despite the fresh legal scandal for VW, analysts said the carmaker was on a path to higher profits compared with dire times in 1993 when the carmaker took a one billion mark charge for restructuring purposes.</p>
<p>&quot;We do know that Skoda has turned around, VW's Brazilian operations are doing well and North America probably remained a loss-maker but looks awfully better,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
