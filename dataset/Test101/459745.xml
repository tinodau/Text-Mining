<p>Volkswagen AG reaffirmed its ambitious rebuilding programme on Friday when the supervisory board renewed chief executive Ferdinand Piech's contract for five more years.</p>
<p>VW's supervisory board had long been expected to give Piech, 59, another term starting in January 1998 after voicing their support when he was under fire by General Motors for allegations of industrial spying when he hired away Jose Ignacio Lopez.</p>
<p>The board's endorsement of Piech was viewed by industry analysts as giving him further power to keep up the rebuilding of Volkswagen that he started in 1993 when he brought on board purchasing guru Jose Ignacio Lopez to revamp VW's operations.</p>
<p>&quot;It was important that Piech stay on after the troubles with General Motors were finished,&quot; said Sabine Bluemel, analyst at IGI Sigeco in London.</p>
<p>&quot;He is the driver behind the restructuring,&quot; Bluemel said.</p>
<p>Lopez resigned last November, about a month before VW reached a settlement over GM's allegations that he stole secret GM documents when he led a group of executives who defected to VW in March 1993.</p>
<p>The settlement, which called for VW to pay GM $100 million and buy $1 billion worth of parts, ended a U.S. civil lawsuit in which Piech was named as a defendant, prompting speculation that he would be forced off the Volkswagen board.</p>
<p>But VW on Friday reaffirmed that Piech, the grandson of VW founder Ferdinand Porsche, was fully in charge at the carmaker and would keep up the restructuring programme that he started with a staggering 1.5 billion mark write-off in 1993.</p>
<p>One sign of his control was the announcement that management board member Martin Posth would leave VW, ending 25 years with the carmaker. Board member Robert Buechelhofer will take over Posth's responsibilities for the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Volkswagen said Posth, a board member for nine years, was leaving the company &quot;by mutual agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>Sources in the German car industry have frequently spoken of clashes between Posth and Piech over the past few years and he becomes one of the last board members that Piech inherited to leave the group.</p>
<p>Also on Friday, VW said the supervisory board gave formal approval to its 1996 results that showed a 77 percent rise in group income from ordinary activities to 1.97 billion marks and a net profit of 678 million marks.</p>
<p>VW's board approved an employee share purchase programme that will call for the Wolfsburg-based carmaker to raise its base capital by 135 million marks in a bid to allow its 265,000 employees to participate in the carmaker's profits.</p>
