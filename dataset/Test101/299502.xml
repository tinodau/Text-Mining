<title>GERMANY: Lopez reputation based on drive for efficiency.</title>
<headline>Lopez reputation based on drive for efficiency.</headline>

<p>Jose Ignacio Lopez is a walking business school case-study whose reputation rests on far more than being the focus of a fierce battle between two of the world's car giants.</p>
<p>Lopez, at the centre of a dispute between Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp. over allegations of industrial espionage, has been one of the most dynamic players in the global automobile industry.</p>
<p>The two car giants settled their spat on Thursday, although Lopez, who has denied allegations that he stole documents from GM when he quit in 1993 to join VW, still faces criminal charges.</p>
<p>The 55-year-old Spaniard, a slim balding figure, preaches the need to save Western civilisation through a new Industrial Revolution and efficiency in every area of life.</p>
<p>For Lopez, efficiency goes beyond his merciless pressure on parts suppliers to cut prices or his success at both GM and VW in radically changing the way cars are produced.</p>
<p>It goes as far as avoiding red meat and demanding loyalty from subordinates, whom he calls &quot;co-warriors.&quot;</p>
<p>He dictated diets for his lieutenants that were high in fiber and fruit and even told them to wear watches on the right wrist to remind them that their work was never done.</p>
<p>In making his mark on the car industry, Lopez first helped turn around the European operations of GM in the 1980s, saving billions of dollars by squeezing parts suppliers to cut prices and convincing them that it was an honour to do business with GM.</p>
<p>VW, Europe's largest carmaker, admired the ascent of the charismatic Lopez through the GM ranks. After he became the head of global purchasing at the world's largest carmaker in 1992, VW lured him away with a huge pay raise.</p>
<p>He did his job well, transforming the lethargic VW, which had a 1 billion mark ($635 million at current rates) restructuring charge in 1993, into a lean operation able to build cars at competitive prices for world markets despite the strength of the German mark.</p>
<p>The plan was simple -- transfer vehicle assembly and parts production to subcontractors, essentially converting an automaker to a brand name that keeps strict control over quality.</p>
<p>Subcontractors not only supply the building blocks but also assemble some components themselves and even complete vehicles, creating an environment of high productivity and low costs.</p>
<p>Lopez even gave the subcontractors help, sending his underlings out to show them how to maximize production.</p>
<p>His theories were put into practice at VW's truck and bus plant in Brazil and a new factory in the Czech Republic where VW operates its Skoda unit -- both designed by Lopez.</p>
<p>The problem is that GM says Lopez got the revolutionary ideas from the Detroit carmaker in tens of thousands of documents he is alleged to have taken along, including plans for a new super-efficient factory dubbed &quot;Plant X.&quot;</p>
<p>Lopez, whose VW salary reportedly more than tripled from his $375,000 base compensation at GM, and his underlings no longer work for VW and face German criminal charges for allegedly stealing the documents.</p>
<p>But Lopez, who grew up in the Basque region of Spain and is currently living in his country of origin, is likely to keep working in the car industry as a consultant.</p>
<p>He still has to fulfil his dream of building a car factory in his homeland region, where officials have set aside 1 million square meters (10.8 million square feet) of land for a plant.</p>
