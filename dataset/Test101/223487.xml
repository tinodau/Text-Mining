<p>Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, expected to resign from his post as production chief at Volkswagen AG on Friday after accusations he stole trade ideas, won recognition as a cost-cutting crusader.</p>
<p>His talents earned him the nickname of &quot;Superlopez&quot; but his reputation has been tainted by accusations that he took industrial secrets on purchasing and car production when he defected to VW from General Motors in early 1993.</p>
<p>The accusations, consistently denied by VW and steadfastly upheld by GM and its German subsidiary Adam Opel AG throughout a three-year legal battle, look set to prompt his resignation at a supervisory board meeting on Friday, sources close to VW said.</p>
<p>VW, which largely owes its return to profitabilty to Lopez, declined to comment, but pressure on the carmaker has mounted following a series of adverse court decisions in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The flood of accusations has not dimmed the strong feelings of support the 16,000 people of Amorebieta hold for its most famous son, who himself has always denied the charges.</p>
<p>In the grim industrial town where he grew up, his friends remember a side of Lopez that eludes those more familiar with his image as one of the world's most merciless cost-cutters.</p>
<p>&quot;Goodness is the word that best describes him. He is a person who radiates tranquility and confidence,&quot; said a friend from his engineering school days.</p>
<p>&quot;Our village follows the news about the accusations against Jose Ignacio with a lot of interest, but we are confident that it will be resolved,&quot; said boyhood friend Jaime Fernandez Amar.</p>
<p>Lopez, married to a Basque woman for 27 years, continues to visit the town and his mother, who lives in a modest flat.</p>
<p>For the townspeople he remains the honest, God-fearing, patriotic Basque they watched grow to manhood.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only did we study together,&quot; said the friend from Bilbao engineering college, where Lopez studied from 1959 to 1966, &quot;we also participated in Catholic organisations, and as much for me as for him religious convictions and morality continue to play an important role.&quot;</p>
<p>Many count on Lopez's love of his homeland and his know-how to help revive his town's industrial aspirations and save it from becoming a bedroom community for nearby Bilbao. They hope he will help set up a car factory here.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a man of his town, a hard worker who has always achieved what he wanted,&quot; said a local journalist.</p>
<p>But, Volkswagen discarded initial plans to build a factory in Amorebieta in 1993. A second project, to open a truck plant, also failed to materialise when VW opted for Brazil.</p>
<p>However, the provincial government of Vizcaya says talks with the German automaker have been reopened and it has reserved one million square metres of land should they end well.</p>
<p>A few young people showed a touch of scepticism.</p>
<p>&quot;One thing is what they say and another is what they do,&quot; said a young barman and neighbour of Lopez's mother.</p>
<p>But for many his character remains unquestioned.</p>
<p>&quot;Knowing him, I can vouch that he has never done anything against his conscience,&quot; said the journalist. &quot;Everything they said he robbed he did not need to take because he had it in his head. They were his own ideas.&quot;</p>
