<headline>Reno to announce FBI spy case involving Russia.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-12-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh called a news conference Wednesday to announce that an FBI agent has been accused of spying for Russia, federal officials said.</p>
<p>They said the agent, who worked at the FBI facility in nearby Quantico, Virginia, was arrested on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>The officials said the suspect, an FBI agent since 1983, worked on national security matters -- catching spies -- at FBI headquarters and at the FBI office in New York. The agent most recently had been transferred to the FBI training facility in Quantico after falling under suspicion, they said.</p>
<p>It was not known how long the alleged spying had been going on or how serious the damage had been as a result of the classified documents allegedly passed to Moscow.</p>
<p>The revelation of the new spy case followed the arrest last month of a CIA officer, Harold Nicholson, on charges of spying for Russia.</p>
<p>The news conference at 2:30 P.M. (1930 GMT) at FBI headquarters will concern &quot;a major development in a significant criminal case,&quot; the FBI and Justice Department said in a brief statement. The two agencies said there also would be an initial appearance in the case at 1 P.M. (1800 GMT) before a federal judge in nearby Alexandria, Virginia.</p>
