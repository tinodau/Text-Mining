<p>Israel's Foreign Ministry on Thursday summoned Egypt's ambassador to make clear it wanted an Israeli man charged in Cairo with spying to be released, a ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know if I could call it a formal complaint but Israel's position will be made clear,&quot; spokesman Ygal Palmor told Reuters before the 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) meeting with Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny.</p>
<p>&quot;The man had nothing to do with any intelligence operation and of course the conclusion is he should be set free.&quot;</p>
<p>Egyptian officials said on Monday that Azam Azam, 35, would stand trial with three other people on charges of spying for Israel and damaging Egypt's national interests.</p>
<p>The case of Azam, chief mechanic at an Israeli-owned factory in Egypt who was arrested in November, has caused friction in already strained Egyptian-Israeli relations.</p>
<p>Israel said he was innocent and appealed for his release but Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said that once Israel made the case public he could not interfere with the legal system.</p>
<p>Other defendants in the espionage case are 34-year-old Egyptian Emad Abdelhamid Ismail and two Israeli women who are not in Egypt -- Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna.</p>
<p>Egypt's prosecutor general on Monday referred the four to trial and issued the charge sheet.</p>
<p>The prosecution said Azam and Ismail had both confessed to the charges. Azam denied the espionage charges in December in his first public appearance in an Egyptian court for a hearing to extend his detention.</p>
