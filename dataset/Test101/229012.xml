<p>Volkswagen AG chief executive Ferdinand Piech on Monday took over some of the responsibilities of a VW executive who resigned amid an industrial espionage row with rival carmaker Opel.</p>
<p>An internal memo by Piech to top VW executives dated on Monday said Piech has taken over group-wide control of &quot;product optimisation and procurement&quot; following the resignation last Friday of VW production guru Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.</p>
<p>Lopez, dubbed the &quot;cost killer&quot; and credited with helping the turnaround at VW after it posted a billion-mark loss in 1993, is the target of a German criminal probe into allegations he stole secret documents when he left Opel AG that year.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Lopez said the 55-year-old Spaniard, who is also named in a U.S. racketeering lawsuit filed by Opel and parent company General Motors Corp, resigned to prepare his defence against the U.S. charges and other legal issues.</p>
<p>GM and Opel executives have declined to predict how much they would seek in a trial but observers have speculated at between $4 billion and $5 billion -- an amount which could be tripled under a U.S. racketeering law first used to fight the mafia.</p>
<p>The management reshuffling at VW included the naming of Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, who followed Lopez to VW from GM, to the VW management board from his current position as a senior executive at VW's Spanish subisidary SEAT.</p>
<p>Garcia Sanz will be on the VW management board to oversee VW purchasing activities, according to the memo obtained by Reuters. VW executive Peter Hartz was also named to take over Lopez's duties with VW's America and Africa units.</p>
<p>Piech made the management changes as VW shares on Monday fell nearly six percent after GM said it would not let up on its legal battle against the Wolfsburg-based carmaker, Europe's biggest.</p>
<p>Volkswagen shares fell 34.50 marks to 582 marks but pared some of the losses, which were tied to foreign sellers, to end bourse trade down 29.50 marks at 587 marks.</p>
<p>Speculation about a possible out-of-court deal over the U.S. lawsuit has risen after Lopez quit his post on Friday -- one of the conditions GM laid down for any settlement.</p>
<p>Opel chief executive David Herman told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Monday that a deal was &quot;desirable&quot; but reaffirmed that GM and Opel still wanted a public apology from VW as well as hefty monetary damages.</p>
<p>VW officials have said they would not meet the conditions and have denied the allegations made by the U.S. auto giant.</p>
<p>GM officials on Monday also said statements from VW that Lopez will stay with VW as a consultant were insulting, saying they wanted Lopez never to work again for VW.</p>
<p>GM officials were also astounded at VW saying it would meet the obligations of Lopez's contract, which runs through March 1998. A VW official said Lopez would get about four million marks ($2.60 million) for his contract that runs through March 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;This is absolutely not sufficient,&quot; said one GM executive who asked not to be named. &quot;Letting him resign and then having top executives praise him and say that they can see him as a top consultant in the future does not meet our requirements.&quot;</p>
