<p>General Motors Corp on Wednesday denied a press report that it was poised to make a fresh effort to settle its dispute with Volkswagen AG, saying discussions with VW were neither taking place nor planned.</p>
<p>A Zurich-based spokesman for the giant U.S. carmaker, which has been feuding bitterly for over three years with VW over alleged industrial espionage, told Reuters: &quot;There are no talks taking place and none are planned.&quot;</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal Europe earlier cited sources close to GM as saying that talks between the car giants were expected to resume quickly and a settlement could soon follow.</p>
<p>VW said it did not wish to comment on the report.</p>
<p>VW and GM are clashing over allegations that GM's former purchasing manager Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua stole company secrets when he switched from GM to VW in 1993.</p>
<p>Lopez faces a grand jury investigation by prosecutors in Detroit -- proceedings VW hopes to avoid by reaching an out-of-court settlement.</p>
<p>Attempts at reconciliation have so far failed as VW has not met GM's conditions, which are that it sever ties with Lopez, admit wrongdoing and pay damages.</p>
<p>VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech last week expressed his &quot;deepest regrets&quot; for the events surrounding the dispute but said he would not apologise directly. GM said his statement was not enough.</p>
<p>German press reports last week said top executives from VW and GM would meet this week to try to resolve the crisis.</p>
<p>The daily Die Welt reported that VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen and Lower Saxony state premier Gerhard Schroeder would meet with GM executives John Smale and Thomas Wyman.</p>
<p>The newspaper also said VW might attempt to win GM over to an out-of-court settlement by offering to help the U.S. carmaker develop business in China -- a country where VW already has a strong presence.</p>
<p>Lopez quit VW in late November to prepare his legal defence, but VW has said it may still work with Lopez on consulting projects.</p>
<p>Lopez's problems would not be entirely averted even if a deal were made with GM. German prosecutors have filed criminal charges against him and three other executives for embezzlement and betrayal of corporate secrets.</p>
<p>If convicted in Germany, the defendents could face up to five years in prison, although legal experts have said first-time offenders rarely face custodial sentences.</p>
<p>Lopez has appealed for the U.S. civil lawsuit to be delayed to give him more time to defend himself against the criminal charges he faces in Germany.</p>
