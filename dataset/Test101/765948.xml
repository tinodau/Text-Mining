<p>President Emil Constantinescu on Wednesday appointed a close aide with little apparent experience in intelligence work to head Romania's foreign spy agency (SIE), whose chief resigned over a scandal.</p>
<p>A statement from the presidential press office said Catalin Harnagea, 39, an economic and local administration adviser to the president, had been named agency director.</p>
<p>Last week, General Ioan Talpes resigned as head of the SIE, the Foreign Intellgience Service, taking the blame for the case of a Swiss diplomat arrested by Berne over accusations of spying for Romania.</p>
<p>The statement described Harnagea as an engineer by training who had been a journalist for a major Bucharest daily. He became an adviser to Constantinescu a month after he ousted ex-communist Ion Iliescu in presidential elections.</p>
<p>It said Harnagea graduated from the National Defence College in July 1997 after presenting a thesis on &quot;Crisis management and the secret services.&quot;</p>
<p>Since Constantinescu and his centrist allies won last year's elections, they have pledged to bring the Balkan country's intelligence services under full democratic control.</p>
<p>The United States and the European Union have suggested remnants of the Communist-era Securitate secret police have remained in intelligence bodies and encouraged Romania's leadership to clear them out.</p>
<p>The presidential statement said Harnagea was not a member of any political party. But he served as campaign manager for Victor Ciorbea, now Constantinescu's prime minister, when he ran for mayor of Bucharest last year.</p>
<p>Earlier this year,  Constantinescu named Costin Georgescu, the man who ran his own presidential campaign last year, to head the SRI, Romania's counter-intelligence service.</p>
<p>The SRI is the only intelligence body subject to parliamentary control out of a dozen services operating in Romania since the 1989 fall of communism.</p>
<p>Talpes stepped down after Swiss prosecutors said they had detained a diplomat over accusations he handed secret political and economic data to Romanian intelligence, as well as information about people wanted by police.</p>
<p>Both the SRI and SIE denied conducting intelligence activities against Switzerland. But the SIE admitted in a report that &quot;there were sporadic contacts over several years between a Swiss diplomat and SIE collaborators.&quot;</p>
