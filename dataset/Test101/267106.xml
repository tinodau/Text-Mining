<p>Jailed FBI agent Earl Edwin Pitts will plead not guilty to charges of selling classified information to Russia and seek pre-trial release on bail, his court-appointed lawyer said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;He is innocent and is going to enter a plea of not guilty,&quot; the lawyer, Nina Ginsberg, said in a telephone interview with Reuters. She said she would seek to have bail set for Pitts, a 13-year veteran of the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested on Wednesday after a 16-month undercover investigation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Justice Department spokesman John Russell said a federal grand jury in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Virginia formally indicted Pitts late on Thursday. A copy of the indictment was not immediately available.</p>
<p>Ginsberg described Pitts, 43, as being in a &quot;somber&quot; mood when she visited him in jail on Wednesday in Alexandria, where he was being held until at least his next court appearance.</p>
<p>Russell said a bail hearing for Pitts, which had been tentatively set for Friday, was now scheduled for Monday. Ginsberg said she asked the judge to postpone it because she needed more time to prepare.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect to defend Mr Pitts with every available defence; every possible right that he has, he will have the benefit of it,&quot; said Ginsberg, who has practiced criminal law for 17 years.</p>
<p>She said she had not yet decided whether to ask the judge to appoint an additional lawyer or investigator to help her with the case.</p>
<p>The government has alleged that Pitts began to spy for the former Soviet Union in 1987 while working in the New York FBI unit responsible for catching KGB spies. An FBI affadavit alleged he had given up &quot;everything&quot; he could to Moscow from 1987 to 1992, for at least $224,000.</p>
<p>FBI Director Louis Freeh told a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing: &quot;I would not underestimate the seriousness of the damage&quot; allegedly caused by Pitts.</p>
<p>Freeh said Russian intelligence had escalated its efforts to spy on the United States, especially in economic espionage.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that (Russian) aggression has been unabated even in the post-Cold War. It's escalating. It's a serious problem. It's a continuing problem,&quot; said Freeh, whose agency is responsible for catching spies in the United States.</p>
<p>Freeh said at least 23 foreign intelligence services were targeting the United States and its economic infrastructure.</p>
<p>But he said U.S. counter-intelligence efforts had improved, which might be one reason why spies in the CIA and FBI have been uncovered.</p>
<p>The arrest of Pitts on Wednesday came exactly a month after agents took into custody Harold Nicholson, the highest-ranking CIA official to be charged with spying for Russia. Justice Department spokesman Russell said a new grand jury indictment of Nicholson also was handed up late on Thursday.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher said money appeared to be the main motive behind the recent spy cases.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a sad and tragic event to see these Americans who are selling out their country for financial gain. That seems to be the motivating factor in this new era ... selling out your country for just a pittance,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Attorney General Janet Reno vowed at her weekly Justice Department news briefing to conduct a thorough review of the Pitts case to determine whether further steps must be taken.</p>
