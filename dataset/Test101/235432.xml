<p>General Motors will demand at least six billion marks ($3.8 billion) in damages from rival Volkswagen in its U.S. lawsuit over allegations of industrial espionage, a magazine report said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Germany's Stern magazine said the provisional figure was reached by GM estimating that more than 4,000 pages of secret information with prices for about 110,000 car components were taken by top GM executives who quit in 1993 to join VW.</p>
<p>VW has vehemently denied the allegations.</p>
<p>If a U.S. jury were to rule in favour of GM and its German subsidiary Opel, a U.S. racketeering law being applied to the case would automatically triple any damages, making VW liable to pay almost 20 billion marks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said on Wednesday he would discuss the damaging legal fight between VW and GM with U.S. officials at a coming World Trade Organisation meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;I will take along the topic to Singapore,&quot; Rexrodt told reporters in Bonn at a briefing about the upcoming WTO meeting being held from December 7-13.</p>
<p>Rexrodt said &quot;an acceptable solution&quot; must be found for both sides.</p>
<p>Previous published reports have put the damages that GM would seek at anywhere from a couple of hundred million dollars to up to $7.5 billion.</p>
<p>An Opel spokesman declined comment on the Stern report and Opel chief executive David Herman told Reuters on Tuesday that the carmaker had not yet specificed what it would seek from VW.</p>
<p>&quot;What the right amount will be is something that will come out of a full analysis of the facts, including the results of the discovery phase of the lawsuit,&quot; Herman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Stern said the data at the centre of the case helped VW, Europe's largest carmaker, cut annual costs by about four billion marks, saving the carmaker about 10 percent of the 40 billion marks it spends each year on parts.</p>
<p>GM alleges that its former top purchasing executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, used the information to cut some 700 million marks of purchases at Volkswagen and quickly erode the 20 percent cost advantage Opel had over its German rival.</p>
<p>Lopez resigned last Friday from the VW management board, with his lawyers saying he did so to prepare his defence.</p>
