<p>The leader of Volkswagen's Audi luxury car arm has been chosen to lead the German carmaker's Latin American unit following the resignation last week of a controversial VW executive, industry sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The sources said Audi management board chairman Herbert Demel has been chosen to succeed VW executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua -- the target of a German criminal probe into industrial spying allegations -- as head of the regional unit.</p>
<p>A top Audi management board member, Franz-Josef Paefgen, has been selected to replace Demel as head of the Ingolstadt-based luxury carmaker, the sources said.</p>
<p>An Audi spokesman declined comment on the leadership changes at the carmaker but said personnel issues would be a topic of discussion at a Audi supervisory board meeting on Wednesday in the Hungarian city of Gyor.</p>
<p>The Audi spokesman also said there could be a decision at the meeting on a possible new Audi factory in Brazil. Audi has long planned a car production plant in the dollar region to better latch on to the U.S. market.</p>
<p>Lopez, who had headed the Latin American operations at VW, resigned last Friday to prepare his defence for allegations that he and other former executive at Opel AG stole secret documents when they abruptly quit to join VW in March 1993.</p>
<p>He is one of several top VW officials, including VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech, who are named as defendants in a U.S. civil lawsuit filed by GM and its Opel unit that charges the company with industrial spying.</p>
<p>VW on Monday said Piech has taken over some of the VW group duties held by Lopez but also promoted a protogee of Lopez -- and also a defendant in a U.S. lawsuit filed by GM against VW -- to the VW management board in charge of purchasing.</p>
<p>The official, Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, 39, is one of seven close associates of Lopez who left GM with him to join VW. GM has demanded that Garcia Sanz and the others also leave VW before any discussion of an out-of-court settlement.</p>
<p>Several German newspapers have recently reported that Demel, an Austrian who had been in charge at Audi for 2-1/2 years, would give up his position and take up responsibility for Volkswagen's Latin American business.</p>
<p>Demel, who was named management board chairman at Audi in February 1994, has been credited with invigorating Audi to shed its drab image in favour of a carmaker that makes award-winning models, such as the A4 saloon that has underpinned its revival.</p>
<p>He is also considered by industry analysts to be a top contender to succeed Piech, who was also once chief executive at Audi, in the future as the top official at VW.</p>
<p>Paefgen, 50, joined the Audi management board in March 1994 and has been responsible for technical development. He started his career in the car industry as a trainee in 1976 with the German unit of Ford Motor Corp and joined Audi in 1980.</p>
