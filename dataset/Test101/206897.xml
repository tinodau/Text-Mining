<p>The unmasking of another alleged Moscow spy in its ranks dealt the CIA a huge new blow, possibly exposing dozens of undercover agents and details of how the U.S. espionage agency does business around the world.</p>
<p>What may be even worse for Washington, the case of alleged turncoat Harold Nicholson may scare away foreigners targeted for recruitment and dry up contacts with private U.S. citizens who provide information, intelligence professionals said.</p>
<p>&quot;People are going to be a little bit leery of playing closely with Uncle Sam because they fear that there might be another mole hidden there (inside the CIA),&quot; said David Whipple of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers, a 35-year veteran of the CIA's operations directorate.</p>
<p>Nicholson, 46, was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation last Saturday and charged with selling secrets, including the identity of fellow clandestine CIA officers, to Moscow for at least two years.</p>
<p>An instructor at the Central Intelligence Agency's training camp for undercover operatives in Virginia, he may have given away recruitment techniques, spy skills and tricks and agent-handling procedures, U.S. officials fear.</p>
<p>Overseas recruiting is a key part of what CIA operatives like Nicholson do to penetrate hostile governments, criminal gangs and guerrilla groups. Groups targeted include drug runners, nuclear proliferators and those who would steal U.S. national security secrets.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything that tends to dry up (CIA) sources is a body blow, and this has to have that effect,&quot; said Marvin Ott, a former CIA analyst and Senate Intelligence Committee staff member who is now a professor at the National War College.</p>
<p>U.S. officials fear Nicholson also turned over the names of CIA recruits he helped train from 1994 until four months ago. CIA Director John Deutch said on Wednesday that &quot;there is no question&quot; that the discovery of his alleged betrayal had devastated morale at the agency.</p>
<p>Nicholson allegedly began his double-crossing only weeks after the arrest of CIA officer Aldrich Ames in February, 1994. Ames pleaded guilty to selling out to the KGB every top Soviet and East European military and intelligence officer secretly working for the CIA and the FBI.</p>
<p>Unlike in the Ames case, where at least 10 of those foreigners were reportedly killed, the CIA says it knows of no deaths tied to Nicholson, who worked in the Philippines, Thailand, Japan, Romania and Malaysia in his 16-year career.</p>
<p>But the task of persuading someone to spy against their own country, always difficult, has now been complicated by a possible perception that the CIA may have chronic problems keeping its secrets.</p>
<p>The FBI says it found a computer diskette in Nicholson's car containing seven summary reports about CIA &quot;access agents,&quot; private citizens such as business people who briefed the agency after they had traveled to Russia.</p>
<p>Paul Joyal, who helped develop and enforce counter-spy procedures as director of security at the Senate Intelligence Committee from 1985 to 1989, said Nicholson's ability to get such files unrelated to any legitimate &quot;need to know&quot; pointed to a glaring flaw in CIA security.</p>
<p>&quot;It shows a lack of proper compartmentation,&quot; Joyal said, referring to the basic spy agency practice of limiting employees' access to data needed to do their jobs. The CIA declined comment, citing ongoing investigations.</p>
<p>Stunned by a torrent of leaks of highly classified intelligence reports to the Washington Times newspaper, Defense Secretary William Perry warned in July that such disclosures could lead other countries' intelligence agencies &quot;to believe the U.S. to be an unreliable collaborator.&quot;</p>
<p>The CIA's task of signing up foreigners has also been complicated by the end of the Cold War. Previously there had been &quot;an ideological appeal to be made that was very powerful,&quot; said Ott. &quot;It could persuade someone that their higher loyalty was not to the Soviet Union but to certain values,&quot; an argument that may no longer apply, he added.</p>
