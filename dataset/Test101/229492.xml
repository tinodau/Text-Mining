<p>Volkswagen AG shares tumbled nearly six percent on Monday after General Motors Corp said it would not let up on its legal battle against the German carmaker over the alleged theft of secret documents.</p>
<p>Volkswagen shares fell 34.50 marks to 582 marks but pared some of the losses, which were tied to foreign sellers, to end bourse trade down 29.50 marks at 587 marks.</p>
<p>The hefty losses came after GM and its German unit, Opel AG, on Sunday denied they were close to settling a bitter 3-1/2 year dispute over GM's allegations that a top GM official who quit and joined VW in 1993 took along thousands of documents.</p>
<p>Speculation about a possible out-of-court deal has risen after VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, at the centre of the dispute, quit his post on Friday -- one of the conditions GM laid down for any potential settlement.</p>
<p>But VW officials have said they would not meet the other conditions -- a public apology and payment for damages done by the Spanish-born Lopez, 55, for allegedly taking documents on GM's plans for a revolutionary plant and purchasing data.</p>
<p>VW on Monday also sought to stem the losses from the departure of Lopez, dubbed the &quot;cost killer&quot; and credited with the turnaround at VW after it posted a billion-mark loss in 1993, by appointing a number of executives to new positions.</p>
<p>VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech has taken over Lopez's job for purchasing and production optimisation and officials from VW's Czech and Spanish units were given group responsibility for Lopez's other management duties.</p>
<p>Lopez was credited with slashing, by some reports, up to 17 billion marks ($11 billion) in costs by cutting the prices it pays to component suppliers, which can make up half the cost of a car, and by opting to buy more parts from eastern Europe.</p>
<p>VW started courting Lopez in 1992 after Piech, the grandson of luxury sportscar manufacturer Ferdinand Porsch, took over control at the carmaker with plans to restore VW's fortunes.</p>
<p>GM claims that Lopez started leaking information about Opel's plans as early as December 1992 and that he asked for a briefing on future plans just hours before he quit GM in March 1993 and took along a number of executives with him.</p>
<p>GM officials on Monday said statements from VW that Lopez will stay with VW as a consultant was insulting, saying they wanted Lopez never to work again for VW.</p>
<p>GM officials were also astounded at VW saying it would meet the obligations of Lopez's contract, which runs through March 1998 and German media reports that Lopez would receive from four million marks to 11 million marks in compensation.</p>
<p>&quot;This is absolutely not sufficient,&quot; said one GM executive who asked not to be named. &quot;Letting him resign and then having top executives praise him and say that they can see him as a top consultant in the future does not meet our requirements.&quot;</p>
<p>Both sides have said they want to reach a settlement on the U.S. civil court lawsuit filed by GM in Detroit against VW, one that industry officials have estimated could cost VW billions of dollars in a jury verdict.</p>
<p>GM and Opel executives have declined to predict how much they would seek in a jury trial but recent published reports have put the amount at between $4 billion and $5 billion -- an amount that could be tripled under a U.S. racketeering law.</p>
<p>A meeting among lawyers in the case, which also names VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech as a defendant, with the Judge Nancy Edmunds is scheduled for Tuesday in Detroit.</p>
<p>The meeting, called a &quot;status conference, will decide on how both sides will proceed with the sworn testimony of defendants and witnesses. Discussion of a settlement at the meeting was not expected to take place, industry sources said.</p>
