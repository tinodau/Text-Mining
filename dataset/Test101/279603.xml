<p>Ferdinand Piech, chief executive of Volkswagen AG, should apologise to General Motors Corp, Klaus Zwickel, chairman of German union IG Metall, said in an interview with a German Sunday newspaper.</p>
<p>Zwickel, who is a member of Volkswagen's supervisory board, said that the two carmakers, currently involved in a bitter legal dispute, should settle their differences.  </p>
<p>&quot;I would apologise and try to put a halt to this legal avalanche,&quot; Zwickel said in an interview in Sunday's Bild am Sonntag, when he was asked what he would do were he chief executive of Volkswagen.</p>
<p>VW and U.S. carmaker GM are clashing over allegations that GM's former purchasing manager Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua stole company secrets when he switched from GM to VW in 1993.</p>
<p>Zwickel said that VW had profited greatly from Lopez's experience and that Lopez had given production at VW a big boost -- and that the supervisory board had no interest in industrial espionage.  </p>
<p>&quot;The VW supervisory board wanted Lopez because of his great experience, not for the possibility of engaging in industrial espionage,&quot; Zwickel said.</p>
<p>The union chief said that the ongoing legal battle was unsettling employees at both Volkswagen and at GM's German car-making unit Adam Opel AG.</p>
<p>&quot;The employees in both companies want to make cars, not to see a legal wrangle. For over 150,000 people at VW and Opel, car manufacture is their reason for living,&quot; said Zwickel.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's high time that these two companies let themselves be ruled by their responsibilities to their organisations and not by legal tactics,&quot; Zwickel said.</p>
<p>&quot;The competition between the two companies has to be based on the quality of the products they make, not on the quality of their lawyers,&quot; the union chief said.</p>
<p>Zwickel went on to say that the decision by GM to implement legal proceedings in the U.S. against VW had taken the German carmaker by surprise.</p>
<p>Asked if the VW supervisory board would continue to support Piech, Zwickel said: &quot;Piech has been a major asset to Volkswagen and he remains a major asset. Nothing has changed on that front.&quot;</p>
