<p>Volkswagen AG, starting off 1997 predicting better first quarter results due to a 9.5 percent rise in sales, said on Thursday it expected higher profits and sales for the year.</p>
<p>The company's 1996 results got a hefty lift from the German mark's decline in currency markets.</p>
<p>VW said in its 1996 annual report issued on Thursday that it expected &quot;postive results&quot; for 1997 despite forecasts for slow consumer spending as many European nations slash spending to qualify for European currency union set to begin in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect our 1997 earnings to be slightly better than last year,&quot; VW chief financial officer Bruno Adelt said at the carmaker's news conference, toning down his comment in a speech text in which he predicted &quot;overproportional&quot; profit growth.</p>
<p>But VW said on Thursday its 1996 results were hurt by a 1.5 billion mark ($870 million) charge to reduce the interest rate growth forecast for its pension funds to five percent from six percent.</p>
<p>If VW had not opted for the pension fund change, VW officials said the results would have been sharply above the doubling in 1996 group profit of 678 million marks.</p>
<p>VW shares surged on the strong outlook, rising four percent to above 1,000 marks for the first time in VW history.</p>
<p>VW did not release quarterly results but VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech said the data were above the 1996 first quarter despite the Wolfsburg-based carmaker losing 64 million marks from lost production of about 10,000 vehicles in a strike by Spanish truckers in February that cut off parts shipments.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not make our quarterly results public but I can say that our results were better than last year,&quot; Piech said.</p>
<p>VW said on Thursday sales for the first three months of 1997 rose 9.5 percent to 1.033 million vehicles from 943 million vehicles in the 1995 first quarter, spurred by double-digit growth in many foreign markets, particularly Asia.</p>
<p>But VW said its German sales slumped 4.9 percent to 234,000 units during the three-month period, in part hurt by lost output for its popular Polo model due to the Spanish strike.</p>
<p>The carmaker said it expected the German economy to show limited growth and little improvement in the jobless crisis that may curb car sales. But slower sales growth in Germany and also western Europe should be compensated for by growth in Asia and Latin America as VW steps up its foreign expansion.</p>
<p>VW management board member Robert Buechelhofer said the weaker first quarter German sales could be made up and said VW should show sales growth in its domestic market for 1997 and also defend its leading European market share of 17.2 percent.</p>
<p>VW's forecasts come after it earlier this year reported a near doubling in 1996 group profit to 678 million marks from 336 million marks behind a 10.6 percent growth in sales to 3.977 billion marks and a 10 percent growth in group vehicle sales to nearly four million units.</p>
<p>The carmaker said its 1996 results were aided by about 600 million marks in gains from currency market turbulence and the weakening of the mark against the dollar, lira and pound in late 1996 that reduced the cost of vehicles sold abroad.</p>
<p>Despite overall lacklustre industry conditions, VW said it had seen unexpectedly strong demand for its new Passat saloon and would increase 1997 production by up to 25 percent.</p>
<p>Piech said VW would boost Passat output by up to 100,000 units from the planned 300,000, in part due to demand for a new estate wagon version recently unveiled at the Geneva car show.</p>
<p>The strong demand for the Passat, at the top end of the VW brand product range, comes as VW said on Thursday it would expand its product line to about 50 models in the next three years from the current level of 38 models.</p>
<p>&quot;The expansion of our product line is going to accelerate in the coming years,&quot; Piech said.</p>
<p>Piech defended VW's future goal of using only four vehicle platform structures to build cars under the VW, Skoda, Seat and Audi brands, dismissing criticism by some industry observers that there was not enough differentiation between the brands.</p>
<p>&quot;We remain convinced that the platform strategy that we have developed is still the best way for us to remain competitive,&quot; Piech said. The carmaker currently used 19 different platforms within the VW group.</p>
