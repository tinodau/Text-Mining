<headline>GM reiterates demands for VW settlement.</headline>
<dateline>DETROIT 1996-12-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>General Motors Corp and its Adam Opel AG German subsidiary issued a statement Thursday reiterating that Volkwsagen AG needs to meet certain conditions before GM will settle industrial espionage claims.</p>
<p>GM has demanded that VW acknowledge wrongful conduct occurred and sever its ties with Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former GM purchasing executive who allegedly stole secret files when he defected to VW in 1993.  </p>
<p>GM has also demanded that VW compensate it with a &quot;substantial&quot; financial payment for damages allegedly suffered as a result of actions taken by Lopez and the several other former GM executives who followed him to VW.</p>
<p>&quot;These steps do not threaten, and are not meant to cause any threat to, the jobs of innocent Volkswagen employees, but do begin to address the negative effects the wrongful conduct has had on the employees of Opel,&quot; GM said in its statement.</p>
<p>GM also said it &quot;regrets&quot; that attorneys representing Lopez and three other defendants want to delay GM's civil suit against them in U.S. District Court in Detroit.  </p>
<p>On Tuesday, an attorney representing Lopez and the other three said he plans to request a stay in GM's case against the four. That motion is expected to be filed December 13.</p>
<p>The lawyer, Plato Cacheris, also said he will seek to keep Lopez and the three others from being forced to give depositions, or sworn statements, in the U.S.</p>
<p>Lopez' attorneys have said they expect German prosecutors to bring criminal charges against him before the end of the year. They argue he should not be forced to defend himself against both the expected German criminal and GM civil charges at the same time.</p>
