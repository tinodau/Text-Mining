<p>The former GM executive who defected to Volkswagen asked a federal judge Friday to delay General Motors Corp.'s spying case against him and said he would refuse to testify if forced to come to the United States.</p>
<p>Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, accused by GM of taking company secrets to Volkswagen AG in March 1993, has been charged by German prosecutors along with three others with embezzlement and betrayal of corporate secrets. GM is suing Lopez in a civil suit brought in federal court in Detroit.</p>
<p>Lawyers representing Lopez and Jose Manuel Gutierrez, another former GM executive who followed Lopez to VW, filed a motion to delay the case in federal court. A hearing on the motion, which had been expected, was set for Jan. 29, 1997.</p>
<p>Attorneys argued the GM case should be delayed while the two men defend themselves against the criminal charges in Germany.</p>
<p>Lopez and the others were accused of stealing thousands of documents and computer discs containing secret GM data relating to parts pricing, products and manufacturing plans, when they defected to VW in March 1993.</p>
<p>GM filed its suit in federal court in March making similar charges. Lopez, who was VW's top purchasing executive, and Gutierrez, have resigned from Volkswagen to prepare their criminal defense.</p>
<p>Because the criminal and civil claims are similar, the two will be unable to respond to GM's allegations because of the risk of incriminating themselves in the criminal case, the motion said.</p>
<p>&quot;Lopez and Gutierrez have a constitutional right not to be compelled to furnish the government with even a 'link in the chain of evidence' which might ultimately be used against them, either directly or circumstantially, in a criminal proceeding,&quot; the motion said.</p>
<p>If U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds refuses to delay GM's civil suit, attorneys for the men asked that she temporarily halt the fact-finding process in the case. They also asked that she not force Lopez and Gutierrez to return to the United States to give sworn statements known as depositions.</p>
<p>The lawyers said the men would be advised to not answer questions under their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.</p>
<p>Because the two also face a &quot;real possibility&quot; of U.S. criminal charges, according to their lawyers, the Justice Department could serve them with subpoenas and arrest them if they appeared in Detroit.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a risk they should not be required to assume while German charges are pending and U.S. charges are threatened,&quot; the motion said.</p>
<p>GM spokesman John Mueller said Friday the company expects its case to proceed against all the defendants at the same time. He declined to comment on whether GM's case would be hurt if it cannot question Lopez.</p>
<p>Volkswagen said that since it was not implicated in the German criminal investigation, the filing of charges against Lopez cleared the way for new talks to settle GM's civil suit filed in Detroit.</p>
<p>But a GM official dismissed VW's comments, saying there were no talks planned and that the U.S. lawsuit had nothing to do with the German criminal probe.</p>
<p>German prosecutors said they found no evidence that VW executives colluded in the transfer of secrets -- contrary to the allegations made by GM -- even though the data were used by the defendants in presentations to VW executives.</p>
<p>The prosecutors declined to say when a trial could begin.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Lopez, 55, who is believed to be living in his native Spain after resigning from the VW management board in late November, and the others would remain free.</p>
<p>If convicted in Germany, the defendants could face up to five years in prison or a fine. But legal experts say first-time offenders do not usually face prison.</p>
