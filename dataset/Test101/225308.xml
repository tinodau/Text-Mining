<p>German shares were expected to continue to soar next week, after hitting all-time highs on Friday, dealers said, although some said it would be no bad thing if the market took time to consolidate.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX, measuring electronic dealing in 30 leading shares, surged almost ten points above the day's bourse close to touch 2,854.59 points, before pairing gains slightly to stand up 19.21 points, or 0.68 percent, at 2,848.89 points.</p>
<p>Continuing advances in the German bond market, a firmer dollar and a confident opening on Wall Street were all supporting the rally, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Analysts said the crucial 2,900 point level was now in sight for the end of the year and said 3,000 point, once seen as unattainable could even be reached, with the fundamental environment still optimal for the market.</p>
<p>They said much of the rally was sparked by a lack of alternative investment opportunities, given the low level of return in bond markets, where yields are at all-time lows.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, dollar strength continued to boost export-oriented stocks, particularly in the chemicals sector, with Bayer, BASF and Hoechst all strongly ahead.  </p>
<p>Volkswagen was seen continuing to dominate the news, after after the firm accepted the resignation of production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, at the centre of a three year battle between VW and General Motors.</p>
<p>Shares in VW slipped after the news to a day's low of 610.50 marks and then recovered to end bourse dealings up 3.50 marks at 616.50 marks.</p>
<p>Dealers said they were not sure whether the Lopez resignation would mean the end of the legal battle, which was keeping the lid on any more significant recovery in the share price. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525</p>
