<p>Adam Opel AG, the German unit of U.S. carmaker General Motors Corp, said on Thursday its European car sales slipped in the first five months of the year and that it would be hard to keep up profit levels in 1997.</p>
<p>Sales in Germany from January to May fell to 235,000 units from 266,600, which translated into a drop in market share to 15.5 percent from 16.7 percent in the 1996 five-month period.</p>
<p>Opel's share of the west European vehicle market slumped during the five months to 11.8 percent from 12.6 percent in the year-ago period as new car registrations fell to 690,000 units from 724,000.</p>
<p>Despite lower volume sales, Opel said its sales for the five-month period rose 400 million marks to 12.6 billion marks ($7.3 billion).</p>
<p>Managing director David Herman said it would not be easy to match the 1996 net profit of 314 million marks in 1997, which was down 13 percent from 363 million marks in 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not see for 1997 any growth impulses or a change in the competitive environment,&quot; he said at Opel's annual news conference, noting that overcapacity burdened European carmakers.</p>
<p>The weak sales come at a critical time for Opel since it faces stiff criticism from its works council -- a consultative body for employees -- over GM's plans to use Opel to crack emerging markets in Latin America, eastern Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Two senior GM and Opel executives in Europe are reported to have quit in the last two weeks over scepticism about the plan.</p>
<p>It calls for Opel to help build GM plants to raise GM's global production by more than 700,000 vehicles to about three million around the world by 2001. Many of the plants will produce Opel vehicles but will be operated by parent GM.</p>
<p>Herman conceded that the expansion project had created some problems for Opel management, the scope of which was reflected in a recent internal survey of 300 top Opel executives that showed the project would endanger Opel's competitive position in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;It is no question that the challenges facing management are unsually large,&quot; he said. &quot;We see the problems from our expansion and are working with all efforts to find solutions.&quot;</p>
<p>The works council of Opel demanded on Tuesday that the carmaker make clear its position on possible job cuts and boost investment in Germany to secure jobs.</p>
<p>Opel responded on Thursday by saying it would raise 1997 domestic investment by about 50 percent to two billion marks and that it expected Opel vehicle deliveries to improve in the second half of 1997 based on current order levels.</p>
<p>The carmaker also said it had set a goal of maintaining its 1996 market share for the year and for sales to reach a record of about 30 billion marks.</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal in Germany and Europe is to maintain our market share from last year,&quot; Herman said, noting he expected the German market to have about 3.5 million new vehicle sales.</p>
<p>One factor weighing on profit would be the phase-out of the current top-selling Astra model during the rest of the year before the new model's launch in 1998, he said.</p>
<p>Opel said it would also launch the largest product offensive in its history, offering 26 new models by the end of 2001 and six new models alone in 1998.</p>
<p>The new models will include eight new small trucks and a new compact van, called the Zafira, that will be unveiled in September at the Frankfurt car show.</p>
<p>Top areas for investment during the year will include Opel's Bochum plant where the new Astra, expected to be unveiled at the Frankfurt car show, will be produced.</p>
<p>&quot;These investments will improve efficiency and quality in manufacturing,&quot; Herman said, noting Opel had invested about seven billion marks in Germany in the last five years.</p>
