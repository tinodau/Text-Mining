<p>Volkswagen AG  faces a critical week in its fight against rival Opel AG as a German court is set to decide whether to turn over German prosecution materials to their U.S. counterparts also probing the German carmaker.</p>
<p>A Frankfurt appellate court said this week it would decide whether to hand over German prosecutor documents on VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and other suspects to the U.S. Justice Department.</p>
<p>Lopez, a Basque, is being probed by German authorities for allegedly taking along secret documents when he quit Opel and parent company General Motors Corp in 1993 to join VW.</p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors began an investigation shortly after Lopez and three of his associates joined VW and made the request for the German documents more than two years ago.</p>
<p>VW has fought the document transfer by saying the rights of Lopez and other suspects would be violated and that German courts should have jurisdiction over the overall issue.</p>
<p>Lopez's German lawyer said earlier in November that he expected German prosecutors in Darmstadt to soon file criminal charges related to industrial spying against his client. Prosecutors have said a decision would be made by year-end.</p>
<p>If the Frankfurt court complies with the U.S. request for the information, the files could then be put before a U.S. grand jury in Detroit, the hometown of GM, that is also investigating the abrupt switch of Lopez and other executives to Volkswagen.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision whether to turn over these documents to the U.S. authorities is crucial and critical for VW,&quot; said a legal source familiar with the court fight between the two carmakers.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems as though people have forgotten about the U.S. grand jury investigation and that Lopez and others, as well as VW itself, could face criminal charges,&quot; the source said. &quot;People have apparently underestimated the U.S. grand jury.&quot;</p>
<p>VW, which has denied the allegations, said this week it was fully complying with U.S. prosecutors investigating Lopez -- as it has with the German probe.</p>
<p>&quot;Volkswagen has supported the U.S. investigation as much as it has the German investigation,&quot; VW said in a statement.</p>
<p>VW has suffered a series of legal setbacks in recent weeks, including a U.S. district court in Detroit rejecting VW's attempts to have the lawsuit -- which include racketeering charges based on organised crime statutes -- dismissed.</p>
<p>In addition to Lopez, the U.S. lawsuit filed by GM names, among others, VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech.</p>
<p>The Detroit federal court is scheduled to issue a written decision by November 26 on the inclusion of the racketeering charges, which are based on RICO statutes initially used to fight the mafia and whose use has been expanded.</p>
<p>Legal experts familiar with U.S. civil lawsuits said GM getting a U.S. jury verdict in its favour on racketeering charges could see the carmaker facing hefty damages.</p>
