<p>Volkswagen AG boss Ferdinand Piech will remain chief executive following the settlement of VW's dispute with General Motors Corp, the president of the German state of Lower Saxony and VW supervisory board member Gerhard Schroeder said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Piech has successfully led the company for three years and he will remain with us,&quot; Schroder said in an interview in the Saturday edition of the Koelner Stadt-Anzeiger newspaper, released in advance of publication.</p>
<p>A deal was struck on Thursday between Volkswagen and GM's German unit Adam Opel AG over charges that cost-cutting VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez stole GM data when he joined VW in 1994 which ended the possibility of a U.S. jury awarding billion-dollar damages against Volkswagen.</p>
<p>Schroeder denied that the VW management had acted wrongly in the dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not feel damaged in any way. All decisions were agreed unanimously by the VW board and I have no reason to doubt these decisions in hindsight,&quot; Schroeder said.</p>
<p>Schroeder went on to say that the compromise reached in the dispute would not harm German suppliers.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, VW committed itself to enter into supply contracts to buy GM parts worth one billion dollars over a period of seven years.</p>
<p>Schroeder said the parts supply deal had to be seen in the context of the total volume of the VW group.</p>
<p>&quot;Then you will quickly see that German suppliers will not be disadvantaged by this agreement,&quot; Schroeder said.</p>
<p>The settlement also includes an &quot;arrangement&quot; under which VW will pay General Motors 100 million dollars. The two companies will drop all civil litigation against each other or against individuals, which includes a civil action brought against VW in the Detroit Federal Court in March 1996.</p>
<p>The deal was greeted enthusiastically by financial markets and VW shares rose as much as two percent before paring gains on profit-taking. VW shares have risen about 10 percent this week on speculation that a deal would soon rid the carmaker of its legal troubles.</p>
<p>GM sued VW in Detroit last year, alleging that Lopez and his followers stole secret data on GM's future European product plans, parts prices and manufacturing techniques that helped VW slash more than a billion marks in costs.</p>
<p>GM also accused Piech and other top VW executives of conspiring with Lopez, a fiery 55-year-old Spaniard, to plot an elaborate scheme to transport documents to Germany and copy the data into VW's computers.</p>
<p>VW had long denied the allegations but acknowledged in the settlement documents that there was a possibility of illegal activities by Lopez, who quit the VW management board in November.</p>
