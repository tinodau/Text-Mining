<p>An FBI agent identified as Earl Edwin Pitts appeared in federal court on Wednesday after his arrest on charges of passing sensitive classified documents to Russia for money.</p>
<p>Federal judge Thomas Rawles Jones ordered that Pitts be held in jail pending a bail hearing, set tentatively for Friday. Pitts was arrested at work earlier Wednesday at the FBI's training facility in nearby Quantico, Virginia.  </p>
<p>Pitts, 43, of Spotsylvania, Virginia, was charged with attempted espionage, conspiracy to commit espionage, communication of classified information, and conveyance without authority of government property.</p>
<p>Of slight build and with brown hair, Pitts showed no emotion as the judge informed him of his rights and the maximum penalty in the case, which is life imprisonment or the death penalty if certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>Court documents alleged that Pitts conspired with Russian spies from July 1987 through the present -- although he went into a &quot;dormant&quot; capacity in 1992 -- and that he received more than $224,000 from the Russians.</p>
<p>The documents said Pitts gave the Russians sensitive classified documents related to the national defense and personal, medical, and family information about fellow FBI agents, as well as proposed strategies by which the Russians might recruit additional agents.</p>
