<headline>Egypt extends detention for alleged Israel spy.</headline>

<p>A Cairo court has decided to detain for another 45 days an Egyptian who served in the army and who it suspects sold military information to Israel's secret service Mossad, security sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said the military prosecutor had also decided to refer the case to a civilian court after Samir Osman's confessions did not include any military information.</p>
<p>Under Egyptian law, the military courts try people who confess to giving out military information or are in the ranks of the armed forces. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has also referred Moslem militants seeking to overthrow his government to emergency military courts.</p>
<p>Osman, 47, was arrested and held without charge in late 1996. Counter-espionage forces have said Osman met Mossad agents in Greece, Turkey and Hungary or by scuba diving to Israel from the border resort of Taba.</p>
<p>Egyptian government newspapers had said Osman had confessed to providing Mossad with information about the Egyptian navy and the place where he served in the Egyptian military.</p>
<p>The civilian trial of Azam Azam, an Arab-Israeli charged with spying for Israel, opened in Cairo last week. The trial has helped bring relations between Egypt and Israel to their lowest ebb for years.</p>
