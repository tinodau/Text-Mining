<p>Pressure is mounting on Volkswagen AG to settle a U.S. lawsuit alleging it stole secrets from a rival since observers say the carmaker could face several hundred million dollars in damages if the case goes to trial.</p>
<p>Media reports in recent days have said VW has held secret talks with General Motors Corp aimed at settling the civil lawsuit that GM filed last March alleging some VW officials took the secret documents when they left the company.</p>
<p>Both German-based Volkswagen and Opel, the German unit of General Motors, have declined comment on the reports.</p>
<p>But industry sources in Germany said the threat of a judgement against VW in the U.S. civil lawsuit is rising and has prompted more talks between the two companies.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation for VW is so threatening that they are trying to demonstrate to their shareholders that they are seeking to limit the damages,&quot; said one source who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>Contact between the two carmakers -- including a reported meeting in Detroit between VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen and GM executive committeee chairman John Smale -- may lead to a deal in the coming weeks to months, the sources said.</p>
<p>One factor pushing VW to settle the suit is an expected ruling in the coming days by a U.S. judge in Detroit on whether GM can pursue racketeering charges that were first used to fight the mafia and have since been expanded to business cases.</p>
<p>Approval for GM to pursue the RICO law, or the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act, could force VW to pay triple damages if found guilty by a U.S. jury -- and could lead to a payout in the billions of dollars, sources said.</p>
<p>Guidelines for any settlement are expected to at least follow the demands Opel made in August 1993 -- a public apology, the resignation of VW executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and a substantial payout for damages to the carmaker.</p>
<p>Lopez, a Spaniard, and three other former GM executives now at VW, are under investigation in Germany and the U.S. for stealing secret data when they left Opel for GM in March 1993.</p>
<p>Lopez and the others joined Volkswagen after it reported a massive one billion mark loss and then implemented innovative production practices that have since led to hefty profits.</p>
<p>GM has alleged that secret production plans for its &quot;Plant X&quot; were used by VW to build a new plant in Brazil. Other documents related to purchasing contracts were also allegedly stolen by Lopez and three other former GM employees now at VW.</p>
<p>VW has vehemently denied the charges.</p>
<p>Another factor favouring VW seeking a deal was Lopez's lawyer saying in early November that he expected German prosecutors to soon file criminal charges against his client.</p>
<p>In addition, a U.S. grand jury investigation in Detroit into VW and its top executives will also now have the chance to review documents from the German criminal investigation after a Frankfurt court approved last Friday the transfer of documents.</p>
<p>Under U.S. law, criminal indictments can be filed against both a corporation and also the responsible individual members of that company's management.</p>
<p>VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech, who is named as a defendant along with some other top VW executives in the U.S. civil court lawsuit, has said publically that he would stand by Lopez even if he faced the criminal charges.</p>
<p>But Germany's Spiegel said in a report this week that VW has offered to terminate Lopez's contract as part of a deal with Opel. In any case, the magazine said VW's supervisory board has demanded that Lopez leave the company.</p>
