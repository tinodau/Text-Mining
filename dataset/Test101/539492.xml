<p>A senior aide to late president Francois Mitterrand said on Friday the president personally ordered the wiretapping of a newspaper reporter, but said it was justified on grounds of national security.</p>
<p>Gilles Menage, former head of Mitterrand's private office, gave the testimony to a judge investigating allegedly illegal phone taps by Mitterrand's anti-terrorism unit. His statement defied a government order to respect official secrets.</p>
<p>Menage told reporters the president ordered the bugging because Edqy Plenel, investigative reporter for influential daily Le Monde, published sensitive information about Soviet espionage activity in France.</p>
<p>The articles, published in March and April 1985, reproduced &quot;unseen documents of Soviet origin classified very secret&quot;, Menage said.</p>
<p>&quot;The president considered that these revelations constituted an extremely serious attack on the diplomatic interests of France,&quot; he told reporters after his session with Jean-Paul Valat, the investigating judge.</p>
<p>Menage is under investigation for allegedly authorising the anti-terrorism unit in Mitterrand's office to carry out widespread illegal bugging of journalists, lawyers and politicians from 1982 to 1986.</p>
<p>Menage said Mitterrand believed Plenel's articles would put French counter-espionage agents at risk by exposing how a Soviet spy network in France had been unmasked.</p>
<p>The articles &quot;represented a very serious threat to the people or the network that took part in that counter espionage operation,&quot; Menage said.</p>
<p>Plenel told Reuters by telephone the explanation was nothing more than a &quot;smokescreen&quot; and that even if true, the tapping of his telephone still violated freedom of the press laws.</p>
<p>Menage said on Friday he explained to Valat why lawyer Antoine Comte and writer Jean-Edern Hallier, who died recently, were wiretapped, but refused to tell reporters the reasons.</p>
<p>Under a 1991 law, phone taps can be carried out only on grounds of national security, safeguarding economic or scientific interests, and the fight against terrorism, crime or organised crime.</p>
<p>Mitterrand, who served from 1981 to 1995, died last year of prostate cancer just eight months after leaving office.</p>
