<headline>Volkswagen, GM settle Lopez spying dispute.</headline>
<dateline>DETROIT 1997-01-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Automakers Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp. said on Thursday they had reached a settlement resolving the dispute stemming from alleged industrial espionage by former executive Jose Ignacio Lopez.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, the firms said they had &quot;reached a settlement agreement on all civil disputes relating to the Lopez matter between the companies in Germany and the United States.&quot;  </p>
<p>The settlement includes an &quot;arrangement&quot; under which VW will pay General Motors $100 million. VW also has committed itself to enter into supply contracts to buy GM parts worth $1 billion over a period of seven years.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, GM and its German subsidiary Adam Opel AG and Volkswagen will drop all civil litigation against each other or against individuals. That includes a civil action brought against VW in the Detroit Federal Court in March 1996.</p>
<p>The statement said the companies expressed satisfaction they were able to settle the dispute and create an appropriate environment to let them look forward to &quot;a future unencumbered by the legacy of this matter.&quot;</p>
<p>VW also confirmed in a letter sent to GM Thursday that four former GM managers who abruptly moved to VW in 1993 have all either resigned or will take administrative leave.</p>
<p>The letter is part of an agreement that resolves a bitter dispute over allegations the executives, including Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, took industrial secrets with them when they moved to VW in 1993. VW has already accepted the resignation of executives Lopez and Gutierrez. Two more executives, Alvarez and Piazza, will resign, or take administrative leave by the end of January, VW said.</p>
