<p>A detained Israeli man will stand trial in Egypt with three other people on charges of spying for Israel and damaging Egypt's national interests, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>The case of Azam Azam, a 35-year-old chief mechanic at an Israeli-owned factory in Egypt who was arrested in November, has caused friction in already strained Egyptian-Israeli relations.</p>
<p>Israel said he was innocent and appealed for his release but Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said that once Israel made the case public he could not interfere with the legal system.</p>
<p>The other defendants in the espionage case are 34-year-old Egyptian Emad Abdelhamid Ismail and two Israeli women who are not in Egypt -- Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna.</p>
<p>Egypt's prosecutor general on Monday referred the four to trial and issued the charge sheet, which says Ismail agreed to help the two women spy for Israel's intelligence service Mossad.</p>
<p>The prosecution alleged that Ismail worked with Mossad from March to October last year.</p>
<p>Greiss, with whom he was having an affair according to the prosecution, gave Ismail $650 when he was recruited and Shawahna offered to pay him $1000 per month if he helped Mossad, the charge sheet said.</p>
<p>Azam's alleged role in the espionage case was to deliver to Ismail women's underwear inscribed with invisible ink.</p>
<p>The prosecution has not said what kind of information Israel was seeking.</p>
<p>Ismail &quot;received the necessary training to carry out his assignments with the intention of harming the state's interest&quot;, the charge sheet said.</p>
<p>It said Azam and Ismail had both confessed to the charges. But Azam denied the espionage charges in December in his first public appearance in an Egyptian court for a hearing to extend his detention.</p>
<p>The charge sheet said that Ismail told interrogators he was recruited when he went to Israel last February to train at a women's garments factory.</p>
<p>The Egyptian told interrogators he became acquainted with Greiss at the factory and that shortly afterwards she began taking him out to have sex with him in her car.</p>
<p>Ismail said he felt at the time that they were being photographed. He told interrogators that Greiss asked him many questions about Egypt and conditions there after he agreed to work with Mossad.</p>
<p>National Security Authority investigators said they had recorded telephone calls between Ismail and Greiss in which he agreed to obey Mossad orders to go to Hungary, after which he would go to Israel.</p>
<p>The sources said the four would face trial in the Supreme State Security Court and that public prosecutor Raga el-Arabi would ask for the harshest possible sentence, which would be life imprisonment with hard labour.</p>
<p>A date for the trial has not yet been set.</p>
<p>Egypt became the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in 1979 but relations have cooled significantly since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June.</p>
