<title>UK: Closing stock market indices.</title>
<headline>Closing stock market indices.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON</dateline>
<text>
<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Friday.</p>
<p>LONDON - Shares pushed further into record territory, closing higher for the fourth consecutive session and for the 13th time this year as Wall Street continued to defy gravity.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 closed 21.0 points higher at 4,420.3. The index jumped 112 points during the week and has risen by 302 points so far this year.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The IBIS DAX index put a brief round of profit-taking behind it and headed into the weekend back in bullish mood after higher than expected U.S. jobless data gave the stock market a lift.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX-30 index ended the day at 3,419.51 points. Earlier the DAX index, which tracks bourse trade in 30 German blue-chips, finished down 41.40 points at 3,376.20 but showing a rise of 116.56 over the week.</p>
<p>PARIS - Stocks shrugged off news of stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs growth to set a third consecutive closing record. The jobs data, which could lead the U.S. Federal Reserve to nudge U.S. interest rates higher, briefly unsettled the market but French stocks recovered from their lows to push higher.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index finished up 9.36 points at 2,708.28 for a rise of 100.73 since last Friday.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Shares shook off early doldrums to score another record close, extending Thursday's gains above 4,600 points in the blue-chip SMI. Dealers said U.S. jobs data helped shares bounce back from early lows.</p>
<p>The SMI ended at 4,638.9 points. The all-share SPI added 12.79 points to 2,938.44, also a record close, for a gain of 86.88 on the week.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Stocks swung into positive territory to end higher as buy backs in futures emerged to prop up cash stocks which were dashed by Nomura Securities Co Ltd's disclosure of involvement of directors in apparently irregular deals.</p>
<p>The Nikkei 225 ended 157.41 points higher at 18,198.74 to show a drop of 358.26 since last week.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Stocks closed trading on a weak note, chiefly influenced by the cautious trend seen in the U.S. bond and equity markets.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index closed 79.01 points lower at 13,337.35, after hitting a low of 13,304.24 in late afternoon trade. The index has fallen 61.37 since last Friday.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - The share market closed lower, unchanged from midsession levels, with a cautious tone curbing investor interest ahead of the U.S. jobs data.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index lost 8.9 points to 2,438.5 and was down 11.4 from a week ago.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - Industrial shares ended weak in quiet trade ahead of the budget and the futures close-out. Golds were softer on a weak bullion price. Dealers said the market was likely to remain weak ahead of the budget on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The all-share index shed 22.3 points to 7,061.9 for a fall of 83.4 since last week. The industrial index lost 26.4 points to 8,251.6 but was up 7.3 from a week ago, while the golds index dropped 13.5 points to 1,416.6 and was down 148.9 from last Friday.</p>
