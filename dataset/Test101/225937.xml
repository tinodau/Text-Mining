<p>Volkswagen AG, cornered by adverse court rulings in its legal fight with General Motors Corp., Friday sacrificed its production chief in an apparent bid to find an end to the three-year dispute.</p>
<p>Volkswagen said in a brief statement that its supervisory board had accepted a request by Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the cost-cutting crusader at the centre of industrial spying allegations, to resign immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;The supervisory board acceded to the request of Mr. Lopez at today's meeting and agreed to end his contract as management board member with effect from Nov. 29,&quot; the automaker said a statement released during a supervisory board meeting.</p>
<p>But Opel AG, GM's German unit, made clear that Lopez' resignation alone was not going to be adequate compensation for the damages it alleges have been inflicted by the manager.</p>
<p>&quot;The resignation of Lopez is three years overdue and cannot compensate our company for the losses incurred to date,&quot; Opel said in a statement.</p>
<p>It said clarification was needed as to why VW's management had stood by Lopez for so long and called for further legal clarification in the continuing dispute with Volkswagen.</p>
<p>Opel said there remained a need to establish personal responsibility in the case and to assess the damage done to date.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone who is interested in facts, the truth and on ensuring the good name of Volkswagen, will welcome legal procedures to clarify the situation,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>VW stock reached a day's high of 617 marks ($402) after the news of Lopez's resignation -- which traders see as helping take some of the heat off VW in the dispute -- but fell back to trade up 50 pfennigs (33 cents) at 614.50 marks ($400.46) in later computer trade.</p>
<p>VW has consistently denied accusations by GM and its German unit Adam Opel AG that Lopez and three other former GM executives now at VW stole boxes of secret documents and computer disks on purchasing and car production plans when they defected to VW in early 1993.</p>
<p>Lawyers representing Lopez said he had asked to leave VW to concentrate on his defence and to fulfil a long-standing dream to set up a consultancy firm for industrial purchasing.</p>
<p>Lopez had been widely expected to offer his resignation, and the supervisory board, eager to end a battle which threatens to cost VW billions of dollars and do irreparable harm to its reputation, had been expected to accept.</p>
<p>Pressure on VW to reach an out-of-court settlement rose sharply Tuesday when a U.S. district judge in Detroit, GM's hometown, ruled GM could pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and other VW executives, including VW Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech.</p>
<p>Allowing the legal action to proceed under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO), which has been widely used to prosecute the Mafia, triples the amount of compensation VW would have to pay if found guilty. Industry sources say VW may have to pay billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Opel had demanded that VW fire Lopez, apologise publicly and pay compensation in return for an out-of-court deal.</p>
<p>But VW, led by Piech, has given Lopez its full backing throughout the bitter dispute.</p>
<p>In Friday's statement, the supervisory board expressly thanked Lopez for his &quot;excellent&quot; work.</p>
<p>&quot;The board said Mr. Lopez as management board member applied himself for Volkswagen in an excellent way and achieved big successes through his high qualification as an engineer and his personal charisma,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Lopez, a Basque renowned for his ability to streamline production and cut automaking costs, established innovative working practices at VW that helped return it to profitability.</p>
<p>But media reports have speculated that Piech's own future may also be in doubt if the court action goes ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment, there is nothing to suggest that his (Piech's) contract will not be extended,&quot; Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote in a commentary Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;But who is to say what will happen if Piech has to face a U.S. court?&quot;</p>
<p>Sources close to GM said they did not expect Piech to back down in any out-of-court settlement but expected some movement from VW's supervisory board.</p>
