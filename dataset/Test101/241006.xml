<headline>VW rebuffs GM call for more action on Lopez.</headline>
<dateline>WOLFSBURG, Germany</dateline>

<p>Volkswagen AG Friday rejected a demand by General Motors Corp. to distance itself further from Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who is at the heart of a corporate espionage dispute between the two auto giants.</p>
<p>Spoksman Klaus Kocks said that VW was still waiting for clarification on whether charges will be filed against Lopez on allegations he stole secret documents from GM in 1993 when he left the company to join VW.</p>
<p>The comment came after GM and German subsidiary Adam Opel AG earlier said VW needed to take &quot;fundamental steps&quot; if any out-of-court settlement is to be reached in a civil action that GM has brought.</p>
<p>GM said that such steps included acknowledgment by VW that Lopez had acted wrongly while working for VW and that the German car maker should sever business relations with him and other executives who left GM to join VW.</p>
<p>&quot;These steps do not threaten, and are not meant to cause any threat to, the jobs of innocent Volkswagen employees, but do begin to address the negative effects the wrongful conduct has had on the employees of Opel,&quot; GM said in a statement.</p>
<p>VW said it was still waiting for a decision on whether charges will be filed by the public prosecutor's office in Darmstadt, near Frankfurt.</p>
<p>GM also criticised the request of an attorney representing Lopez in the United States for a stay in GM's civil suit.</p>
<p>&quot;GM and Opel continue to seek a judicial determination of the truth as expeditiously as possible in the VW/Lopez case, and believe that the appropriate forum to argue the facts and evidence is in courts of law,&quot; GM said in a statement.</p>
<p>Lopez resigned from the German car maker, Europe's largest, last week, saying he wanted to concentrate on his criminal defence and set up a consulting company. But he may remain in contact with the company as a consultant.</p>
