<p>German prosecutors said Friday that criminal charges have been filed against four former General Motors Corp. executives alleging that they stole corporate secrets when they left GM to join Volkswagen.</p>
<p>Charges were filed against former VW production executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and three other former GM employees, Jose Manuel Gutierrez, Rosario Piazza and Jorge Alvarez, who followed Lopez to VW in March 1993.</p>
<p>They are accused of taking more than 20,000 documents and computer discs with millions of pages of secret GM data with them when they joined the German carmaker, Europe's biggest.</p>
<p>&quot;The aim of obtaining these documents was to use them in the interest of VW after the transfer there,&quot; Gerhard Andres, chief prosecutor at the Darmstadt prosecutors' office, said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said, however, they found no evidence that VW executives colluded in the transfer of secrets -- contrary to allegations made by GM -- even though the data was used by the defendants in presentations to VW executives.</p>
<p>The four were officially charged Dec. 6 with embezzlement and betrayal of corporate secrets. The charges must now be reviewed by a court, which will determine whether the evidence supports the allegations.</p>
<p>Prosecutors declined to predict when a trial could begin.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Lopez, 55, who is believed to be living in his native Spain after resigning from the VW management board in late November, and the others would remain free.</p>
<p>If convicted, the defendants could face up to five years in prison or a fine. But legal experts say first-time offenders do not usually face prison.</p>
<p>Gutierrez, also a Spaniard, also resigned from VW in November, but Piazza, an Italian, and Alvarez, the son of a Spanish industrialist, are still working in Spain for VW or for consulting groups tied to VW.</p>
<p>Andres said the 60-page indictment alleges that Lopez began forming plans to obtain secret GM documents after meeting with VW management board member Ferdinand Piech in November 1993 to discuss his joining the Wolfsburg, Germany-based carmaker.</p>
<p>Then, it is alleged, Lopez approached Gutierrez, Piazza and Alvarez about following him to Volkswagen and they began collecting secret GM data -- on research, planning and purchasing for new factories as well as GM cars under development -- before they left for GM.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Lopez said after the charges were announced that they were based on statements from GM officials and circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p>They also said many documents in question had been handed out to suppliers at GM meetings or were completed in conjunction with a Spanish consortium studying building a new factory in Spain.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the charges did not assess the amount of damage that GM suffered through the loss of its documents because that task was not part of their probe.</p>
<p>Andres also stated that prosecutors in the course of their investigation had found no evidence that VW staff had colluded with Lopez in the theft of documents.</p>
<p>&quot;I say with all clarity that we always kept an eye on this suspicion,&quot; Andres told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;But the investigation found no sufficient indications that someone from VW in any way colluded in the alleged deeds as we have presented them here relating to Lopez and the others.&quot;</p>
<p>Volkswagen said Friday that, since it was not implicated in the German criminal investigation, the filing of charges against Lopez cleared the way for new talks to settle the civil lawsuit GM filed against it in Detroit.</p>
<p>But a GM official dismissed VW's comments, saying there were no talks planned and that the U.S. lawsuit had nothing to do with the German criminal probe.</p>
<p>&quot;As we said all along, the criminal charges in Germany have nothing to do with the U.S. civil court lawsuit,&quot; a GM source said. &quot;There are no settlement discussions at present. Nor are any planned.&quot;</p>
<p>The German criminal charges add to the troubles for Lopez, who also faces a U.S. criminal probe by prosecutors in Detroit in addition to GM's lawsuit, which is partially based on the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisation law first used to fight organised crime.</p>
<p>GM is expected to demand in a jury trial damages in the hundreds of millions of dollars from VW since it claims Lopez used its documents to cut costs by more than a billion marks ($648 million) and that its cost advantages over VW were reduced.</p>
<p>Any award by a jury could be tripled under the racketeering law.</p>
<p>Previous attempts to settle the U.S. lawsuit have failed because VW has rejected GM's conditions, which are that it sever ties with Lopez, admit to wrongdoing and pay damages.</p>
