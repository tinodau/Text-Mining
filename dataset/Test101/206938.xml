<p>Despite CIA and FBI boasts that their cooperation led to the arrest of an accused Moscow spy in the CIA, a U.S. official admitted on Thursday the two agencies bungled another recent Russian espionage case.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think anyone would claim that was a triumph of cooperation,&quot; Associate Attorney General John Schmidt said of the espionage case in which U.S. charges had to be suddenly dropped against former Soviet KGB agent Vladimir Galkin.</p>
<p>A week ago the Justice Department, citing the &quot;national interest,&quot; was forced to drop spy charges against Galkin after CIA Director John Deutch warned that Moscow would retaliate.</p>
<p>Galkin was arrested by FBI agents on October 29 at John F. Kennedy airport in New York on charges of conspiring to steal top-secret information about the &quot;Star Wars&quot; defence programme, a space-based missile-defence programme initiated under President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said the CIA had been told in advance of the proposed move on Galkin and raised concerns, but did not state sufficent objection to block the arrest.</p>
<p>Moscow protested and the episode created a diplomatic embarrassment resolved by Galkin's release. He had retired from espionage work some time ago and, in any case, agents who operate from abroad as he had are customarily expelled rather than arrested if they enter the target country.</p>
<p>At a Justice Department news briefing, Schmidt said that episode was &quot;kind of a footnote in what is the larger pattern of effective, ongoing cooperation&quot; now being pressed by Deutch and FBI Director Louis Freeh.</p>
<p>In announcing on Monday the arrest of veteran CIA officer Harold Nicholson on charges of spying for Moscow for cash since June 1994, both Deutch and Freeh proudly cited &quot;the unprecedented level of cooperation&quot; between their agencies.</p>
<p>The Central Intelligence Agency, which is charged with running intelligence operations abroad, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is supposed to guard the United States against foreign espionage, have a history of friction and rivalry as they pursue sometimes overlapping operations.</p>
<p>A lack of cooperation between them hampered the investigation of CIA turncoat Aldrich Ames, who pleaded guilty in 1994 to spying for Moscow since 1985.</p>
<p>In the Galkin case, Schmidt said there was a question of whether the matter had reached the &quot;appropriate levels&quot; within the various agencies. He added: &quot;It may be more an internal matter for the agencies than something that really relates to the issue of cooperation between them.&quot;</p>
<p>Schmidt also rejected complaints by Nicholson's defence lawyer, Jonathan Shapiro, that the public comments by Deutch and Freeh would prevent his client from getting a fair trial.</p>
<p>&quot;These are matters of large public importance and when events like this occur I think that people in those kinds of positions (agency directors) have an obligation to talk about them publicly,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The two have gone to unusual lengths to showcase FBI-CIA harmony in appearances since the Nicholson arrest, including a joint interview on CNN on Wednesday in which they expressed confidence the government has a strong case against him.</p>
