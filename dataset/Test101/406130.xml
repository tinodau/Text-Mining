<headline>VW says bribery probe data not yet clear.</headline>
<dateline>WOLFSBURG, Germany</dateline>
<text>
<p>Volkswagen AG said Wednesday that it did not have sufficient information to conclude whether allegations of corruption and bribery at the German carmaker had any foundation.</p>
<p>On Monday the carmaker turned over to prosecutors the findings of an internal investigation of allegations that VW workers demanded about 20 million marks ($12 million) in kickbacks from Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB for a plant expansion contract for VW's Czech Skoda unit.</p>
<p>VW, which recently settled a major dispute with General Motors Corp. over alleged corporate espionage by former GM employees, said it would continue its internal investigation into the allegations as well as cooperate with German prosecutors, who so far have identified two people as being involved in demanding and receiving bribes in exchange for VW contracts.</p>
<p>&quot;Volkswagen will strongly investigate all of the corruption allegations through its own probe and by involving the public prosecutors,&quot; VW said in a statement.</p>
<p>The carmaker again called on all suppliers to report any irregularities in dealings with the company and said that legal charges would be brought against any VW employee violating German laws in order to preserve supplier relationships.</p>
<p>As part of the internal investigation, VW has suspended one employee and fired another worker who was then put in investigative custody by prosecutors in Braunschweig.</p>
