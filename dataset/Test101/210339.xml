<title>GERMANY: German court conceals decision in GM-VW case.</title>
<headline>German court conceals decision in GM-VW case.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT, Germany</dateline>
<text>
<p>An appellate court reached a decision Friday on handing over German prosecution documents concerning Volkswagen AG to the U.S. Justice Department, but it declined to announce its decision until next week.</p>
<p>Court spokesman Wolfgang Frank said the decision was being sent to the parties involved before being made public.</p>
<p>The Justice Department had asked for documents on VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and other executives.</p>
<p>Lopez, a Spaniard, is being investigated by German authorities for allegedly taking along secret documents when he quit General Motors Corp. in 1993 to join VW.</p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors, who began an investigation shortly after Lopez and three of his associates joined VW, made the request for the German documents more than two years ago.</p>
<p>VW has fought the document transfer by saying the rights of Lopez and other suspects would be violated and that German courts should have jurisdiction over the overall issue.</p>
<p>Lopez's German lawyer said earlier in November that he expected German prosecutors in Darmstadt to soon file criminal charges related to industrial spying against his client. Prosecutors have said a decision would be made by year-end.</p>
<p>If the Frankfurt court complies with the U.S. request for the information, the files could be put before a U.S. grand jury in Detroit that is also investigating the abrupt switch of Lopez and other executives to Volkswagen from GM.</p>
<p>VW has suffered a series of legal setbacks in recent weeks, including a U.S. district court in Detroit rejecting VW's request for dismissal of the lawsuit, which includes racketeering charges based on organised crime statutes.</p>
<p>In addition to Lopez, the U.S. lawsuit filed by GM names, among others, VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech.</p>
<p>The Detroit federal court is scheduled to issue a written decision by Nov. 26 on the inclusion of the racketeering charges, which are based on statutes initially used to fight the organised crime and whose use has been expanded.</p>
