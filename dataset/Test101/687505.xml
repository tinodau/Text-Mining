<p>Volkswagen AG and the IG Metall trade union said on Wednesday that they have reached a comprehensive wage deal that gives the German carmaker a chance to cut its workforce through an innovative early-retirement plan.</p>
<p>VW and IG Metall, Germany's largest union, reached the deal late on Tuesday. It calls for around 90,000 VW workers in west Germany to receive a 1.5 percent pay raise on August 1 and another 2.5 percent raise in August 1998.</p>
<p>The agreement also includes a pact for older workers at VW that IG Metall said was one of the first of its kind in Germany to deal with retirement issues.</p>
<p>VW said the plan calls for workers to have the option of working part time by receiving 85 percent of their net pay from the age of 55 to 57-1/2, while working the regular 28.8-hour four-day work week at VW.</p>
<p>After reaching 57-1/2, workers will stop working but still receive 85 percent of their net pay until the age of 60 when they would officially retire from the Wolfsburg-based carmaker.</p>
<p>VW said the plan could affect about 10,000 people during the next five years at a cost to the carmaker of about 150,000 marks ($87,000) per worker.</p>
<p>Klaus Zwickel, leader of the IG Metall metal and engineering sector trade union, called the scheme on Wednesday an &quot;excellent example of a socially-acceptable deal between the generations&quot;.</p>
<p>The programme, which is retroactive to the start of 1997, also calls for VW to make top-up pension payments. This means there will be no great drop in pensions for workers who take part in the scheme when they retire.</p>
<p>The deal will help VW to cut its payrolls without  having to make dramatic job cuts as technology gains reduce the amount of time needed to produce vehicles and the number of workers required on assembly lines.</p>
<p>VW is also in the midst of a global expansion programme under which it is building factories in lower-wage areas such as South America and Asia to grab a share of surging demand for new vehicles in emerging markets.</p>
<p>A VW spokesman said the early retirement programme would also help allow VW to keep up to 1,000 trainees per year. The carmaker and IG Metall also agreed that workers would also receive a 500 mark bonus in 1997.</p>
<p>Existing benefits for working on Saturdays will also remain but VW will have a chance to integrate Saturday shifts into the normal working routine.</p>
<p>Three shifts could operate on Saturdays to help to meet current strong demand for its cars and create new temporary jobs, VW negotiation leader Jochen Schumm said.</p>
<p>The wage contract runs until the end of July 1999, while an agreement over job security issues runs to the end of 1999.</p>
