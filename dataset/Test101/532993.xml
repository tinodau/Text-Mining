<p>An Israeli textile worker is to stand trial in Cairo on Thursday on charges of spying for the Jewish state and damaging Egypt's national interests.</p>
<p>The trial of Azam Azam, a 35-year-old chief mechanic at an Israeli-owned factory in Egypt, comes during one of the lowest ebbs in Egyptian-Israeli relations since the two countries signed a peace accord in 1979.</p>
<p>Azam is to stand trial at the South Cairo Supreme State Security Court where prosecutors are expected to ask for the harshest possible sentence, which would be life imprisonment with hard labour.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the trial to add some strain to relations between the two governments but it will put greater strain on already overheated public opinion,&quot; said Saad Eddin Ibrahim, president of the Ibn Khaldoun Centre for Development Studies.</p>
<p>&quot;Public opinion in Egypt is already charged against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel. The anti-peace groups will use the case to renew their arguments that Israel can't be trusted and that it continues to undermine Egypt's security,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Israel has said Azam, who was arrested in Cairo in November, was not working for any of its intelligence organisations and appealed for his release.</p>
<p>Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak told a joint news conference with Netanyahu in Cairo in March he could not interfere with the judicial system.</p>
<p>Mubarak chided Israel for publicising the case, saying it had damaged Azam's chances and he compared it to an earlier incident in which Egyptian authorities discreetly set free two suspected Israeli spies.</p>
<p>&quot;Our political leaders have already told President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ministers that this man is innocent and we believe Egyptian justice will show this,&quot; said the Israeli embassy's minister counsellor Koby Brosch.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't even want to think he (Azam) will not face a fair trial, I am sure he will,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The other defendants in the espionage case are 34-year-old Egyptian Emad Abdelhamid Ismail and two Israeli women who are not in Egypt -- Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna.</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege that Ismail agreed to help the two women spy for Israel's intelligence service Mossad when he went to Israel in 1996 to train at a women's garments factory.</p>
<p>Greiss, with whom the prosecution said Ismail was having an affair, gave the Egyptian $650 when he was recruited and Shawahna offered to pay him $1,000 a month if he helped Mossad, according to the charge sheet.</p>
<p>Azam's alleged role in the espionage case was to deliver to Ismail women's underwear inscribed with invisible ink.</p>
<p>The prosecution has not said what information Mossad was seeking but said that Azam and Ismail had both confessed.</p>
<p>Azam denied the spying charges in December in his first public appearance in an Egyptian court for a hearing to extend his detention.</p>
<p>Egypt became the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in 1979 but relations have been cool at the best of times and took a turn for the worse since the right-wing Netanyahu came to power last year. Israel's groundbreaking last month to build a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem fuelled the tension.</p>
<p>An Egyptian news magazine last month said Egypt secretly executed an Egyptian man for spying for Mossad two years ago.</p>
<p>In a separate case, Egypt's counter-espionage service has in its custody 47-year-old Egyptian Samir Osman who is suspected of selling military information to Mossad. Osman has not been charged yet.</p>
