<headline>FBI official says 200 spy cases under investigation.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-01-31</dateline>

<p>An FBI official said on Friday that about 200 espionage cases remain under investigation and that resources devoted to catching spies in Washington, D.C. have increased since the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Raymond Mislock, in charge of the national security division at the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Washington field office, told reporters that the Russians &quot;still are on the scene,&quot; and continue to employ intelligence officers in this country.</p>
<p>Asked about the 1993 disclosure in the book &quot;The FBI&quot; by Ronald Kessler that the law enforcement agency was investigating 200 spy cases, Mislock replied, &quot;The number is extremely high. That's a good number.&quot;</p>
<p>In November, the FBI arrested CIA officer Harold Nicholson, a 16-year veteran and the highest-ranking CIA officer ever indicted on espionage charges. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of spying for Russia since mid-1994.</p>
<p>A court hearing in the case, which was set for trial in March, has been scheduled for Monday.</p>
<p>The FBI last month arrested one of its own agents, Earl Pitts, charging him with selling national security secrets to Moscow since 1987.</p>
<p>Mislock said the Russians were not the only country to pose an espionage threat to the United States, calling it a &quot;broad-based threat.&quot;</p>
