<title>USA: Boehringer, Johnson &amp; Johnson in settlement.</title>
<headline>Boehringer, Johnson &amp; Johnson in settlement.</headline>
<dateline>INDIANAPOLIS 1997-01-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Boehringer Mannheim Corp and Johnson &amp; Johnson said they agreed to settle issues that led last year to claims and counterclaims alleging inappropriate competitive activity.</p>
<p>Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.  </p>
<p>Boehringer on June 19 last year filed a lawsuit against J&amp;J and its Lifescan unit alleging that Lifescan &quot;illegally obtained a product prototype, infiltrated private Boehringer meetings and stole confidential documents.&quot;</p>
<p>The six-count lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis. It alleged Lifescan engaged in industrial espionage against Boehringer for at least 17 months.</p>
<p>The two companies compete in the diabetes care market.</p>
<p>J&amp;J acknowledged the Boehringer lawsuit and said an internal probe showed Lifescan gained no competitive advantage from information improperly obtained from Boehringer.  </p>
<p>Boehringer is based in Indianapolis, but has much of its operations in Germany, as well as California and Maryland. The healthcare products company had 1995 sales of $700 million and is owned by privately held Corange Ltd, of Bermuda.</p>
<p>New Brunswick, N.J.-based J&amp;J is one of the world's largest healthcare products and pharmaceuticals manufacturers. It had 1996 sales of $21.62 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;Boehringer Mannheim and Johnson &amp; Johnson are pleased that they were able to reach an out-of-court settlement, as they believe the settlement is in the best interest of both companies and their customers,&quot; the companies said jointly.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for both companies said they were precluded from making further comment by the terms of the legal settlement.</p>
<p>In its statement last summer, Boehringer said the industrial espionage allegedly occured between September 1992 and March 1994 at the direction of Lifescan executives. Boehringer said it was seeking compensatory damages from J&amp;J in an unspecified amount.</p>
