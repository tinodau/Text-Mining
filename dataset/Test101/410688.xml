<p>An FBI agent accused of selling U.S. national security secrets to Russia since 1987 has agreed to plead guilty, federal law enforcement sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said a court hearing had been scheduled for later in the day in Alexandria, Virginia, for agent Earl Edwin Pitts, in which he would enter the guilty plea to the espionage charges.  </p>
<p>Pitts, a 43-year-old lawyer and a 13-year FBI veteran, was arrested on Dec. 18 for allegedly selling secrets to Russia in exchange for $224,000. Pitts, only the second FBI agent to be arrested for alleged spying, was caught as a result of an FBI undercover operation.</p>
<p>Pitts, who had been in the FBI's New York City unit responsible for catching Russian spies, has been charged with attempted espionage, conspiracy to commit espionage, communication of classified information and conveyance of government property without authorization.</p>
<p>His trial had been scheduled for April 21, but a trial will no longer be needed because of the plea deal reached with prosecutors.</p>
<p>A court appearance for Pitts was scheduled at 4 p.m. (2100 GMT) at the federal courthouse.</p>
