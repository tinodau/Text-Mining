<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Friday.</p>
<p>LONDON - British shares ended mixed as investors took profits in blue chips after this week's record-setting rally and funnelled those profits into mid-caps, which have lagged far behind the key FTSE 100 so far this year. The FTSE 100 closed at 5031.3, down 55.5 points but up 132 points on the week.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - German shares ended a lacklustre bourse session lower as overnight weakness on Wall Street and a touch of pre-weekend catharsis hit sentiment on the stock exchange. The DAX-30 index closed at 4354.15, down 60.20 points and down 54.64 from last Friday. In later screen-based trade the IBIS DAX index ended at 4342.31, down 85.77 points.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares fell nearly two percent as a retreat in the dollar and U.S. stocks prompted heavy profit-taking on the bourse. The CAC-40 index closed down 60.07 points at 2996.27, a fall of 53.17 on the week.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares ended one percent lower as profit-taking, a weaker dollar and losses in early Wall Street trade took their toll, dealers said. The Swiss market index closed at 5864.8, down 57.3 points and down 33.4 from last week.</p>
<p>MILAN - Italian stocks slid lower throughout Friday to close sharply down weighed by falls in Wall Street, other European bourses and world bond markets, dealers said. The All Share Mibtel index closed at 14572, down 250 points and down 123 on the week.</p>
<p>AMSTERDAM - The Dutch sharemarket dived into negative territory, finishing lower for the first time in four days but bouncing off the day's lows. The AEX index closed at 996.16, down 14.81 points but up 15.42 points on the week.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks reversed early losses to close modestly higher, supported by a technical rebound and a recovery in construction shares, brokers said. The 225-share Nikkei average closed at 19604.46, up 128.61 points but down 199.92 from last Friday's close.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell a sharp 157 points, or 0.94 percent to 16,516, just after the start of trading morning, a much-needed correction after the market's record-breaking run, brokers said. The Hang Seng index closed at 16647.54, down 25.73 points but up 268.32 on the week.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - The Australian share market turned weaker again in the last half-hour as bellwether BHP took a new blow when it announced yet another resignation from senior ranks. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2711.4, down 6.3 points and down 16.1 from a week ago.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African industrial shares ended weak after taking a fright from Wall Street which fell more than 100 points shortly after the opening, dealers said. The All-share index closed at 7599.2, down 15.2 points but gaining 142.4 on the week. The All Gold index closed at 996.4, up 29.3 points and gaining 32.7 on the week, while the Industrial index closed at 9283.4, down 30.8 points but up 137.9 from last Friday.</p>
