<p>Ending one of the most bitter fights in corporate history, automakers Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp. Thursday reached an out-of-court settlement of alleged industrial espionage by executives who quit GM to join VW.</p>
<p>In exchange for GM dropping its U.S. racketeering lawsuit against Volkswagen, the German automaker agreed to pay $100 million to GM and committed to purchasing $1 billion worth of GM auto parts over the next seven years.</p>
<p>VW also acknowledged the possibility of illegal activities by Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and others who abruptly left GM to join VW in March 1993.</p>
<p>GM sued VW in U.S. District Court in Detroit last year, alleging that Lopez and his followers stole secret documents on GM's future European product plans, parts prices and manufacturing techniques that helped VW slash its costs.</p>
<p>GM also had accused VW Chairman Ferdiand Piech and other VW executives of conspiring with Lopez, a fiery 55-year-old Spaniard, to plot an elaborate scheme to transport the documents to Germany and copy the information into VW's computers.</p>
<p>VW will sever all ties to Lopez until March 2000 as part of the deal, according to GM officials. When Lopez resigned as VW's production chief in November 1996, VW executives had said they would continue to use him as a paid consultant -- a decision that infuriated officials at GM and its Adam Opel AG unit in Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;That's been taken care of. Lopez will not be a consultant for VW until at least the year 2000,&quot; said the GM official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The settlement, hammered out this week in secret talks in Detroit, brought to an end a nearly four-year-old dispute and eliminated the risk of a multi-billion dollar jury verdict against VW in GM's hometown of Detroit.</p>
<p>Both automakers, who are bitter rivals in Europe, said in a joint statement they looked forward to &quot;a future unencumbered by the legacy of this matter.&quot;</p>
<p>In a letter to GM that is part of the settlement, Piech confirmed that VW had accepted the resignations of Lopez, Jose Manuel Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez and Rosario Piazza, who face criminal charges filed by German prosecutors in December.</p>
<p>VW said it &quot;acknowledges the possibility that illegal activities by the individuals may have occurred. These allegations remain to be proven or disproven.&quot;</p>
<p>The settlement does not affect the German criminal case, nor a similar criminal investigation in the United States.</p>
<p>VW, in accepting that GM's actions were &quot;not designed to harm Volkswagen's image,&quot; also retracted statements made by company officials that included allegations GM employees may have tampered with evidence later collected by prosecutors.</p>
<p>GM Chairman Jack Smith and board member John Smale said in a letter to Piech and supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen that GM will abide by the decisions of prosecutors in the criminal investigations.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts said the deal will save both automakers millions of dollars and management time associated with litigation.</p>
<p>One attorney involved in the U.S. lawsuit said the cost of bringing the case to trial would have run into  hundreds of millions of dollars. &quot;It would have been a great case to try, but the companies are better off this way,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. auto analyst Kenneth Blaschke said GM probably could have won a bigger monetary settlement had it held out longer, but it wanted to put the dispute behind it to avoid damage to its reputation.</p>
<p>He added that the parts contract, which will bring $143 million in new annual revenues to GM's Delphi Automotive Systems unit, will translate to increased annual profits of about $4.4 million, or one cent a share.</p>
<p>VW now purchases about $300 million in GM-produced parts per year, the majority of which are electrical wiring harnesses for cars.</p>
<p>Lopez, who slashed purchasing costs at GM-Europe in the late 1980s, wasted no time in shaking up Detroit's automotive suppliers when Smith named him GM's director of worldwide purchasing in 1992.</p>
<p>But VW, eager slash its own bloated costs, pursued him doggedly, offering a position on the management board.</p>
<p>VW shares rose in Frankfurt to a record 706.90 marks ($448.50) on speculation that a settlement was imminent. GM shares closed unchanged Thursday at $59.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
