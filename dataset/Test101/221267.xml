<p>Opel AG, the German subsidiary of U.S. car giant General Motors, on Wednesday demanded the sacking of a top Volkswagen AG executive at the centre of industrial espionage charges before it would consider an out-of-court settlement.</p>
<p>The call came after a U.S. judge in Detroit, the hometown of GM, decided to allow the carmaker to pursue racketeering charges against the VW executive, production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and other VW bosses, including management board chairman Ferdinand Piech.</p>
<p>The decision pushed shares in Volkswagen -- Europe's largest carmaker -- down almost six percent on Wednesday. VW shares fell as much as 38 marks to 601 marks before recovering slightly to trade at 604.50 marks at midday.</p>
<p>Opel, dismissing speculation that it was currently in talks with VW to reach a deal on a U.S. civil court lawsuit, said Lopez must go before any hint of improving relations.</p>
<p>Other demands from Opel, first laid out in August 1993 after Lopez left GM in March 1993 for VW, must include a public apology by top VW executives and an unspecified payment for damages, Opel reiterated.</p>
<p>&quot;Volkswagen management has not acceded to these fundamental and equitable bases for an honorable and fair resolution of this matter,&quot; Opel said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than take these necessary steps, Volkswagen management has continued to deny any wrongdoing and has supported Lopez by retaining him as a senior member of management,&quot; the Ruesselsheim-based carmaker said.</p>
<p>Volkswagen has declined to respond to repeated requests for comment on Opel's demand that Lopez be sacked.</p>
<p>Opel made the announcement after Germany's Spiegel magazine at the weekend said the carmakers were in talks to settle the lawsuit linked to Lopez and other former Opel executives now at VW, who allegedly stole secret documents before they left.</p>
<p>Spiegel said VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen and GM executive committeee chairman John Smale had recently met in Detroit to consider a possible out-of-court settlement.</p>
<p>Opel said it was not its policy to comment on the status of confidential talks but felt obliged &quot;to correct misleading information that has been disseminated to the public&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;There are currently no settlement negotiations in progress between Opel and General Motors and Volkswagen,&quot; Opel said.</p>
<p>Mounting speculation about a deal comes after GM and Opel have racked up a series of courtroom victories in recent weeks against VW and Lopez and strong comments from management at both carmakers about their willingness to pursue VW and Lopez.</p>
<p>Lopez's lawyer has said he expected German prosecutors to soon file criminal charges against his client, another black eye for VW as it seeks to maintain profits in a difficult European automobile market.</p>
<p>In addition, a U.S. grand jury in Detroit will soon have the chance to review documents from the German investigation after a Frankfurt court approved last Friday the transfer of the documents to the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI.</p>
<p>Volkswagen downplayed the impact of the Detroit ruling.</p>
<p>&quot;This has nothing to do with the merits of the allegations, but merely whether they are legally sufficient, being taken as true, to state a claim,&quot; VW quoted its U.S. lawyer, Jim Denvir of the firm Aikin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld, as saying.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds said in a written order that GM's complaint alleging that VW stole confidential documents adequately met the standard needed to proceed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO).</p>
<p>If a jury finds VW damaged GM, VW could be forced to pay out triple the amount of damages, according to the RICO law.</p>
<p>The statute, which has been widely used to prosecute the mafia in the U.S., requires proof of an ongoing conspiracy or enterprise that aims to commit fraud or other criminal acts.</p>
<p>Under the RICO law, GM claimed that Lopez, VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech and other executives were in a conspiracy to steal documents and transport them to Germany.</p>
<p>GM, in the the civil court lawsuit filed last March, claims the documents included information on future product plans, parts prices and manufacturing techniques and unfairly allowed VW to reduce its costs, causing GM to suffer hefty damages.</p>
