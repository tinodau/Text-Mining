<title>EGYPT: Israel demands Egypt release spy suspect.</title>
<headline>Israel demands Egypt release spy suspect.</headline>
<dateline>CAIRO 1996-11-12</dateline>

<p>Israel denied on Tuesday that an Israeli arrested in Egypt had been spying for the Jewish state and demanded his release.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to see his immediate release so that he can return to his family which is waiting for him. Our obligation...is to demand his immediate release,&quot; Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told reporters in Cairo.</p>
<p>&quot;He is innocent of any wrongdoing and we will not rest until we see him return to his family, his country and his homeland,&quot; said Levy, in Egypt for a Middle East economic conference.</p>
<p>Egyptian government newspapers said on Tuesday security authorities had arrested an Israeli and an Egyptian a few days ago on charges of spying for Israel.</p>
<p>The daily al-Ahram said several charges, including espionage, were brought against the two men and a prosecutor had ordered them remanded for 15 days.</p>
<p>&quot;Security authorities uncovered the involvement of an Egyptian and an Israeli of Arab origin in working for the Israeli intelligence body Mossad,&quot; al-Ahram said.</p>
<p>&quot;Information confirmed the defendant Azam Azam, 35, of Arab origin, who was sent by Mossad, gave the Egyptian citizen Emad eddin Abdel Hamid materials...that are used in espionage.&quot;</p>
<p>Israel's charge d'affaires in Egypt, Jacob Gil, told Reuters on Monday that Azam, who had been working at a Cairo textile factory, was abducted when he returned to the Baron Hotel in the suburb of Medinet Nasr last Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;His father says people from security took him away. We checked this at a very high level and they know nothing about it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Egyptian newspaper al-Gomhuria said state security investigations confirmed that Mossad had lately sent to Cairo one of its &quot;prominent members&quot; to work with the Israeli textile firm Tefron.</p>
<p>Egypt's interior ministry said it had no information on the case. &quot;We can neither confirm, nor deny the reports,&quot; a ministry official told Reuters. &quot;We know nothing about the case.&quot;</p>
<p>Cairo newspapers described Hamid variously as an employee of a private company or the owner of a clothing factory. One said Azam recruited him to spy for Israel in return for money.</p>
<p>Egypt in 1979 became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel.</p>
