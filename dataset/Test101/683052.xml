<p>The head of Iran's judiciary Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi said on Tuesday jailed journalist Faraj Sarkuhi had been charged with espionage and would be tried soon, Iranian radio reported.</p>
<p>&quot;Sarkuhi was charged with espionage and an attempt to leave the country illegally and his trial will begin soon,&quot; the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, quoted Yazdi as telling a news conference. It did not specify when the trial would be held.</p>
<p>Sarkuhi, editor of the monthly Adineh (Friday), has alleged in a letter smuggled out of Iran that he was held for six weeks and tortured by the Iranian secret service in Tehran late last year to force him to confess to spying for Germany.</p>
<p>In Paris, the League of Human Rights and the press freedom watchdog group Reporters sans Frontieres (Reporters without Borders - RSF) said Sarkuhi's trial had already begun and that he was being deprived of the right to a lawyer.</p>
<p>RSF, citing Sarkuhi's brother Ismail as its source, said the trial began on Monday behind closed doors &quot;somewhere in Tehran&quot;.</p>
<p>Both organisations, in separate statements, expressed concern about Sarkuhi's fate, and RSF noted that espionage was punishable by death in Iran.</p>
<p>The London-based human rights group Amnesty International said on Tuesday it believed Sarkuhi was a prisoner of conscience and was concerned about the trial.</p>
<p>&quot;We are deeply worried that Faraj Sarkuhi may not receive a fair trial and in fact risks facing the death penalty,&quot; Amnesty International said in a statement.</p>
<p>Sarkuhi's wife, Farideh Zebarjad, who lives in Germany, has expressed concern that he is being held as a bargaining chip to put pressure on German authorities.</p>
<p>A German court in April ruled that Iran's leadership ordered the killings of a group of Iranian Kurdish exiles in Berlin in 1992. Iran denied the charges.</p>
<p>Germany downgraded relations with Tehran and, along with most EU members, recalled its ambassador for consultations after the court verdict. Germany's ambassador has still not returned.</p>
<p>Sarkuhi was also one of six Iranian writers held briefly after security agents burst into a dinner function at the home of the German cultural attache in Tehran, Jens Gust, in July.</p>
<p>Tehran later expressed regret over the incident after Bonn protested about the action in which the German news weekly Der Spiegel said the agents threatened Gust with violence, locked him in a room and interrogated him.</p>
<p>In a 14-page handwritten letter published early this year by several German newspapers, which Bonn believes is genuine, Sarkuhi said he had been held by the Iranian secret service and forced under torture to confess in a taped interview that he had spied for Germany.</p>
