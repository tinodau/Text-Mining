<p>The outgoing vice-chairman of Czech Skoda Auto a.s., a unit of Volkswagen AG , rejected as &quot;nonsense&quot; on Wednesday a German magazine report connecting him to a VW bribery affair under investigation.</p>
<p>Volkhard Koehler was unexpectedly replaced on Skoda's board last week, and a subsequent story in the weekly Der Spiegel said it was because he had prevented an investigation into a bribery affair linked to VW employees and was involved in dubious real estate transactions.</p>
<p>A Skoda spokesman, Milan Smutny, said in a statement on Wednesday that Koehler had spoken to economic corruption investigators in the German city of Braunschweig who confirmed that he was not the subject of any investigation.</p>
<p>&quot;The state prosecution office confirmed that (Koehler) is not the target of any investigation,&quot; Smutny said. He quoted Koehler as saying Der Spiegel's claims were &quot;absolutely nonsense&quot;.</p>
<p>VW chairman Ferdinand Piech said last week that corruption allegations, which centred on a plant expansion contract for Skoda awarded to Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB , involved &quot;a nearly double-digit sum in the millions of marks&quot;.</p>
<p>He said a probe into allegations that VW employees have demanded and received bribes in return for contracts, had so far turned up only one employee who has since been suspended.</p>
<p>The employee was not named.</p>
<p>Piech said the figures involved are well below German media reports that have said the contract was worth some 400 million marks and included bribes of about 20 million marks.</p>
<p>VW said its purchasing division in the summer of 1994 approved a 74 million mark contract for a Skoda paint factory and a second contract worth 38 million marks to expand the facility.</p>
<p>Smutny said that all decisions on purchases over 100,000 marks at Skoda had to be approved by officials at Volkswagen headquarters in Germany.</p>
<p>German prosecutors in Braunschweig have said they were investigating two suspects as part of their probe at VW, brought about by the carmaker in a formal legal request.</p>
<p>Smutny said Koehler was expecting another assignment from VW headquarters in Wolfsburg after his stint with Skoda ends on April 15. He said that the non-renewal of his contract conformed to standard Volkswagen practice.</p>
<p>The functions of Skoda board members named last week will be announced in a news conference on April 3, Smutny said.</p>
