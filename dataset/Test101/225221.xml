<p>Volkswagen AG, cornered by adverse court rulings in its three-year legal fight with General Motors Corp., on Friday sacrificed its production chief in an apparent bid to end the dispute.</p>
<p>Three days after a court ruling stepped up pressure on VW, the company's supervisory board accepted the resignation of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the production official accused by GM of stealing documents when he and several others left GM to join Europe's largest automaker in 1993.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Lopez said he had asked to resign to concentrate on his defense and to start his own consulting firm. VW praised the 55-year-old Lopez and continued to maintain that he did not steal industrial secrets from GM or its German subsidiary Adam Opel AG.</p>
<p>While officials on both sides were tight-lipped, speculation swirled that the companies planned further talks to try to settle the dispute, which could end up costing VW billions of dollars if it loses in court.</p>
<p>&quot;Investigations by independent auditors have given no indications that Opel secrets were passed on to VW, and no indications that Lopez colluded with VW employees to transfer secrets,&quot; VW supervisory board Chairman Klaus Liesen told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;No one can claim VW has acted improperly,&quot; Liesen said.</p>
<p>GM and its Opel unit said Lopez's resignation was long overdue and was not sufficient to settle the case.</p>
<p>&quot;The resignation of Lopez is three years overdue and cannot compensate our company for the losses incurred to date,&quot; Opel said in a statement.</p>
<p>Pressure on VW to settle the case rose on Tuesday after a U.S. District Judge in Detroit, GM's home town, ruled that the world's largest automaker could pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and other VW executives, including VW Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech.</p>
<p>Allowing the case to proceed under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), which has been widely used to prosecute the Mafia, triples the amount of money VW would have to pay if found guilty. Industry sources said that could amount to billions of dollars.</p>
<p>One U.S. auto industry expert said he believed GM's senior executives want adequate compensation from VW on their civil claims in the United States, but would ultimately prefer to not put their company through a bitter trial, which would create a side show and distract from its primary business.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think they want the auto business to turn into an international soap opera, and that's what would happen,&quot; said David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Center for the Study of Automotive Transportation in Ann Arbor, Mich. &quot;It's not one of those things that's good for anybody.</p>
<p>Now that Lopez is gone, Cole said he believed there will be some other public actions taken, such as an apology from VW. &quot;They would like to have this thing disappear, but they would like to have the world know that VW did something wrong.&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In its civil lawsuit filed in March, GM alleged that Lopez and several associates stole confidential documents when they left for the German automaker.</p>
<p>VW has consistently denied accusations that Lopez and other former GM executives now at VW stole boxes of secret documents and computer disks on purchasing and car production plans when they defected to VW in early 1993.</p>
<p>GM officials declined to comment on whether the two sides were holding settlement talks.</p>
<p>VW's Piech said the two companies had discussed a settlement in three rounds of talks without conditions, and that VW would not bend to any conditions now. While Lopez' resignation fulfilled a key demand by GM and Opel, the companies have also asked for financial compensation and a public apology.</p>
<p>A source at Opel said Friday that recent talks between the two sides went nowhere because GM and Opel officials felt VW's offer was not in the ballpark.</p>
<p>A former GM manager who joined VW with Lopez will also resign, Piech told reporters, adding he hoped Lopez would continue to work for VW as a consultant.</p>
<p>In a statement on Friday, VW's supervisory board thanked Lopez for his &quot;excellent&quot; work. A Basque known for his ability to streamline production and cut costs, Lopez established innovative working practices at VW that helped return it to profitability.</p>
<p>Liesen said VW would meet its commitments under Lopez' contract, which was due to expire in March 1998. He did not elaborate.</p>
