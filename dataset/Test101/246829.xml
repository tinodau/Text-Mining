<p>Volkswagen AG, seeking to deflect publicity over allegations it had secret documents from a rival, said on Tuesday it expected 1996 group profit to be clearly above the 1995 levels and hinted at a higher dividend.</p>
<p>VW said group sales would reach about 100 billion marks in 1996 and top the 1995 level of 88.1 billion marks. Worldwide deliveries also rose 400,000 to almost four million vehicles.</p>
<p>&quot;All group brands have contributed to these positive developments,&quot; VW said about the growth in customer vehicle deliveries, particularly outside its main market in Germany.</p>
<p>Top profit-producers inside the VW the group were the Volkswagen brand, its luxury car unit Audi, the VW financial services unit as well as the South American region, Africa and Asia-Pacific, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>VW declined to give specific 1996 forecasts. The Wolfsburg-based carmaker reported a 1995 group net profit of 336 million marks while parent net profit was 410 million marks.</p>
<p>Volkswagen's debt ratings were also reaffirmed on Tuesday by Standard &amp; Poor's, but the credit agency said it had not factored in the company's running legal battle with U.S. rival General Motors Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;With respect to the ongoing litigation between General Motors and Volkswagen, the potential exists for a significant monetary settlement or court judgment which could impact existing ratings,&quot; S&amp;P said in a statement.</p>
<p>But it added that the likelihood, amount and timing of either a settlement or a decision on damages could not be assessed yet, and the ratings made no assumption about pending litigation.</p>
<p>VW has been in a near four-year legal battle with GM over the transfer of a top GM production executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech on Monday said he regretted the trouble and costs suffered by GM over the 1993 transfer of Lopez.</p>
<p>He said the transfer was &quot;fully legal&quot; but did not comment directly on allegations that Lopez and seven other former GM associates stole secret documents when the quit GM.</p>
<p>The carmaker also said VW and its Audi luxury unit would equally split a 750 million mark investment in a planned production plant in Brazil with the parent company.</p>
<p>VW said the new plant would start production of the A3 car by 1998. VW would also produce its Vento model at the plant.</p>
<p>Volkswagen said it expected more &quot;positive business developments&quot; in 1997 despite overall difficult industry conditions with little sign of an improvement in demand for automobiles in Germany as well as Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;With cautious views on expectations for growth and currency market movements, Volkswagen sees for 1997 further sustained positive business developments,&quot; the carmaker said in a statement, noting it would keep up cost-cutting efforts.</p>
<p>VW chief financial officer Bruno Adelt told Reuters that the carmaker would consider raising its dividend payout after final profit figures for the year were completed.</p>
<p>&quot;If the earnings outlook improves, then we will consider raising the dividend,&quot; Adelt told Reuters.</p>
<p>Among its foreign units, VW said its Spanish SEAT unit had improved over 1995 and that its Czech Skoda subsidary would &quot;be in the black&quot; with profits by the end of 1996.</p>
<p>VW said the worldwide automobile market was uneven during 1996, particularly in Europe.</p>
<p>But the carmaker said 11-month sales from January to November showed that it had raised its group-wide west European market share to 17.1 percent from 16.7 percent of a market with sales of about 2.4 million vehicles for 1996.</p>
