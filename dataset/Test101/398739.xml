<title>GERMANY: VW turns over documents to investigators.</title>
<headline>VW turns over documents to investigators.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT, Germany</dateline>
<text>
<p>Volkswagen AG said Monday it turned over the findings of its internal investigations to prosecutors probing allegations that employees at the German automaker demanded and received bribes from suppliers.</p>
<p>A VW spokesman declined to discuss the content of the information, which was handed over to prosecutors in the nearby city of Braunschweig, and said the automaker has not yet decided whether it would make them public.</p>
<p>The findings of VW's internal inquiry had in some cases been gathered by private investigators.</p>
<p>VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said Sunday it promised a &quot;comprehensive explanation&quot; of corruption allegations in a statement to be released Wednesday.</p>
<p>The allegations refer to a series of possible corruption cases among suppliers, including allegations that some suppliers charged higher invoices to skim off some of the excess cash to pay the VW workers involved with the contracts.</p>
<p>Prosecutors in Braunschweig have said they were investigating two people as part of the probe into allegations some VW employees demanded millions of dollars in kickbacks from Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri for a plant contract for VW's Czech Skoda unit.</p>
<p>VW has suspended one purchasing department worker and fired another, who was then placed in investigative custody by German prosecutors, in recent weeks as allegations of the bribery scandal began to emerge.</p>
