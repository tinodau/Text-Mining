<p>A federal grand jury Thursday indicted three Taiwanese nationals, including two employees of a major paper company in Taiwan, on charges of attempting to steal trade secrets from drugs maker Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.</p>
<p>An investigation was continuing into whether the paper company, a subsidiary of Yuen Foong Yu Paper Manufacturing Co Ltd., was itself involved in the alleged attempt to steal technology to make the anti-cancer drug Taxol, authorities told a news conference.</p>
<p>The paper company has previously denied any involvement in the case, which orginated with an FBI sting operation centered on an undercover firm the agency billed as a &quot;technological information broker.&quot;</p>
<p>There has been no indication of Taiwanese government involvement in the alleged crime, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Levy said.</p>
<p>The case was the second brought under 1996 U.S. law against economic trade espionage, and illustrates a new-style international espionage in which trade secrets are the goal, Bob Reutter, special agent in charge of the Philadelphia FBI office, told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;With the end of the cold war, espionage is no longer about stealing atomic secrets or military secrets,&quot; Reutter said. &quot;Espionage today is becoming stealing economic strength.&quot;</p>
<p>Bristol-Myers sold $800 million worth of Taxol in 1996, he said. &quot;I don't need to tell you how significant the trade secrets and the technology associated with them would be to Bristol-Myers Squibb,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Two of those indicted, Kai-Lo Hsu and Charles Ho, were arrested last month and were released on $1 million bail each to detention in their homes in the United States.</p>
<p>Authorities have issued a warrant for the arrest of the third indicted person, Jessica Chou, who is believed to be in Taiwan, which lacks an extradition treaty with the United States.</p>
<p>Legal documents described Hsu as technical director of the Yuen Foong Paper Co Ltd, in Taipei, and Chou as manager of business development at the firm, which is a subsidiary of Yuen Foong.</p>
<p>Ho was described as a professor at the National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan and director of a biotechnology innovation center there.</p>
<p>The FBI established the undercover firm in 1994. The agency wanted to investigate possible economic espionage, but did not have the Taiwan firm as a target, Reutter said. The undercover company is no longer in operation, he said.</p>
<p>The indictment says Chou approached the unidentified undercover firm in 1995, and later asked for information about the manufacture of Taxol, a drug used to fight ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>At a February 1996 meeting in Los Angeles, Hsu told the undercover agent his company wanted to diversify into biotechnology using imported technology, according to the indictment.</p>
<p>When told Bristol-Myers would probably object to selling the information, Hsu allegedly replied &quot;we'll get another way,&quot; and asked the agent to try to find a Bristol-Myers employee willing to sell the information.</p>
<p>Hsu and Chou allegedly agreed to initially pay $400,000 for the Taxol technology, the indictment said. Hsu and Ho were arrested after a June 14 meeting in Philadelphia in which they discussed the deal with a person posing as a corrupt Bristol-Myers employee.</p>
<p>After the arrests in June, a spokesman for Yuen Foong called the allegations &quot;completely groundless and untrue.&quot; The spokesman said the company had been approached by a U.S. investment consulting firm, Mano Associates, to discuss possible technology cooperation.</p>
<p>Bristol-Myers did not immediately retun a call seeking comment on the case.</p>
<p>All three of those indicted were charged with attempted theft of trade secrets and conspiracy to commit commercial bribery as well as various related offenses.</p>
<p>Levy said Hsu faces a maximum penalty of 60 years in prison and a $2.5 million fine if convicted, Ho faces a total of 30 years and a $1 million fine and Chou faces 55 years and a $2.25 million fine.</p>
