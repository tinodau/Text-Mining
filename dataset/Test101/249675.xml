<title>GERMANY: VW executive charged over industrial spying.</title>
<headline>VW executive charged over industrial spying.</headline>

<p>A former top Volkswagen AG executive accused of stealing secret documents when he quit General Motors Corp. in 1993 to join VW was hit with criminal charges, his attorneys said Wednesday.</p>
<p>But the lawyers for Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who quit as VW production chief in November, quickly played down the significance of the charges, despite noting that prosecutors said they had &quot;sufficient suspicion&quot; that GM documents were stolen.</p>
<p>&quot;The thorough investigation did not conclude that General Motors sustained relevant damage,&quot; Juergen Taschke and Eberhard Wahle, who represent Lopez, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The public prosecutors' office in Darmstadt near Frankfurt would only say that it would file criminal charges against Lopez and would hold a news conference Friday.</p>
<p>Sources have told Reuters that Lopez will face two charges for embezzlement and betrayal against GM. But the indictment does not include more serious fraud charges that can carry up to a 10-year jail term.</p>
<p>The expected charges against Lopez are punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine, but first-time offenders do not usually face prison, according to legal experts.</p>
<p>The criminal charges add to the mounting legal troubles for Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard who is also the target of a U.S. racketeering lawsuit filed in Detroit by GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG, against VW and several of its top executives.</p>
<p>GM is expected to demand in a jury trial damages in the billions of dollars from VW. The award could be tripled under U.S. racketeering laws first used to fight organised crime.</p>
<p>Attempts to settle the lawsuit have failed because VW has refused to meet GM's conditions, which include severing ties with Lopez, admitting to wrongdoing and paying for damages.</p>
<p>GM on Wednesday also said German prosecutors had informed it that charges would be filed against Lopez proteges: former VW executive Jose Manuel Gutierrez, VW employee Rosario Piazza and Jorge Alvarez, who works at VW's SEAT unit in Spain.</p>
<p>It was not yet clear what charges would be filed against Spaniards Gutierrez and Alvarez as well as Piazza, an Italian.</p>
<p>Volkswagen said it would take no actions against any employees who might be charged by German prosecutors and moved to quash rumours that the contract of VW management board Chairman Ferdinand Piech would not be renewed past 1997.</p>
<p>VW supervisory board Chairman Klaus Liesen said there was &quot;no doubt&quot; that Piech's contract would be extended after recent media reports said Piech may be dropped and replaced by Mercedes-Benz AG Chief Executive Helmut Werner.</p>
<p>GM and Opel said their allegations against Lopez and VW were vindicated by the charges and that VW must have been in the possession of secret GM and Opel documents.</p>
<p>&quot;By filing the charges, the Darmstadt public prosecutors' office has confirmed the initial suspicion of industrial espionage raised by Adam Opel AG,&quot; Opel said, noting it had not yet been given full access to the criminal charges.</p>
<p>Volkswagen rejected GM's allegations as being without basis and said GM's attacks have &quot;collapsed like a house of cards.&quot;</p>
<p>VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said the German criminal charges proved incontestably that a conspiracy at VW to use GM secrets as alleged by the U.S. automaker had never existed.</p>
<p>&quot;VW had neither requested nor used any secrets belonging to an outsider,&quot; Kocks told Reuters.</p>
<p>A GM source scoffed at Kocks' comments, saying the betrayal of secrets charges to be filed against Lopez and others would be linked to allegations they passed on GM documents to VW.</p>
<p>&quot;These people are being charged with felonies punishable, if convicted, by jail terms,&quot; the GM source said.</p>
