<p>A Frankfurt court will decide this week whether to give U.S. authorities the results of an investigation by German prosecutors into allegations of industrial espionage against senior Volkswagen AG executives, a court said on Monday.</p>
<p>A Frankfurt appellate court spokesman said a decision on the request by the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI for information from the probe into VW executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua &quot;would come in the course of the week&quot;.</p>
<p>Volkswagen AG has filed a lawsuit in the Frankfurt court to try to prevent information concerning Lopez and other top VW executives collected by German prosecutors from being sent to U.S. investigators, court spokesman Wolfgang Frank said.</p>
<p>U.S. authorities began their own independent criminal investigation into the allegations of spying in 1993 shortly after Lopez abruptly quit Opel, a unit of General Motors Corp., to join Wolfsburg-based VW, the largest carmaker in Europe.</p>
<p>Lopez has been under investigation for allegedly taking confidential documents from Opel and GM, which have waged a nearly four-year legal battle in the U.S. and Germany against him.</p>
<p>VW has vehemently denied the charges and VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech has said he would support Lopez despite the criminal investigation.</p>
<p>Lopez, a Basque renowned for his ability to streamline production and cut carmaking costs, established innovative working practices at VW that helped the carmaker return to profitability.</p>
<p>A lawyer for Lopez said in early November that he expected German prosecutors to file industrial spying charges by the end of the year against Lopez. He is also the target of a civil lawsuit in the United States filed by GM against senior VW officials, including Piech.</p>
<p>The lawyer said he expected the German charges to relate to allegations that Lopez and others took secret plans related to the design of a super-efficient manufacturing plan called &quot;Plant X&quot; that GM had under development.</p>
<p>Three other VW executives in the German criminal probe, who have been identified as Jose Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez and Rosario Piazza, left Opel shortly after Lopez defected to VW and allegedly helped bring documents to VW, he said.</p>
<p>Volkswagen has suffered a series of legal defeats in its battle against GM in recent weeks.</p>
<p>A U.S. court refused in October to throw out the civil charges filed by GM and a Frankfurt court rejected in early November a 10 million mark ($6.64 million) defamation lawsuit against statements made by GM and Opel executives about VW.</p>
<p>Opel issued a statement on Monday saying that VW's support of Lopez was &quot;highly unusual and has corresponding implications for the reputation of the German business community&quot;.</p>
<p>The carmaker, which is based in suburban Frankfurt, said it wanted VW executives to clarify their support for Lopez under oath during testimony in the U.S. civil lawsuit.</p>
