<p>Volkswagen AG said on Thursday it had fired a purchasing department employee and that he had been put under investigative custody by German public prosecutors.</p>
<p>The Wolfsburg-based carmaker said the man was recently dismissed for allegedly submitting falsified or unwarranted contracts after they were discovered during an internal probe.</p>
<p>VW spokesman Klaus Kocks declined to say whether the man, said to be a long-time employee, was part of a probe into charges that VW workers demanded and received bribes for a contract to expand a paint factory for VW's Czech Skoda unit.</p>
<p>But sources close to the investigation said the man has been linked to the probe into charges some VW employees demanded and received about 20 million marks in bribes to award a 400 million mark paint factory contract to Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB AG/AB.</p>
<p>VW has previously announced that another VW employee was suspended in late January as part of a VW probe into bribery allegations about the contract awarded to a German unit of ABB.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, public prosecutors in Braunschweig, which is near VW's headquarters in Wolfsburg, said on Thursday they have begun a probe into the activities of two unidentified people.</p>
<p>VW on Monday asked prosecutors in Braunschweig to begin the probe after a report in Der Spiegel magazine this week detailed allegations of corruption at VW and Adam Opel, the German unit of General Motors Corp.</p>
<p>Swiss prosecutors this week also detained two people for allegedly trying to seek one million marks, the balance of a 20 million mark payment, from ABB officials. Prosecutors have said the two men appeared to have played minor roles.</p>
