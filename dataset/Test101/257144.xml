<p>A senior Volkswagen official hopes criminal charges filed by German prosecutors in the Lopez case of alleged industrial espionage could influence the U.S. lawsuit on the matter, a German newspaper said on Saturday.</p>
<p>On Friday, German prosecutors said charges had been filed against four former General Motors executives including Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua -- who went on to become VW's chief of production -- accusing them of stealing GM documents when they left the U.S. car-maker for VW in 1993.</p>
<p>But the prosecutors said they found no evidence that VW executives colluded in the transfer of secrets, contrary to allegations made by GM.</p>
<p>Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper said Klaus Liesen, VW's supervisory board chairman, said he hoped General Motors would now remove such accusations from a U.S. trial that could result in GM demanding huge damages.</p>
<p>&quot;I can only assume that GM will now take the opportunity to examine whether the part of the (U.S.) civil action directed against VW board members in office can still be justified,&quot; he was quoted in an advance copy of ahead of publication on Sunday.</p>
<p>Lopez, who resigned from VW in November, is accused of stealing secrets from his former employer, including plans for a new factory in Spain and documents for a new car being developed by GM.</p>
<p>German prosecutors said the charges filed on Friday did not measure the extent of potential damages because it was not their role to do so.</p>
<p>VW shares have recently been under stiff pressure on the Frankfurt stock exchange, where they are among the DAX-30 index of leading German stocks.</p>
