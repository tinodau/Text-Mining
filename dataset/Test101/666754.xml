<p>A Taiwan paper company on Tuesday denied FBI charges that its subsidary planned to steal trade secrets from U.S. pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.</p>
<p>&quot;According to our initial understanding, the allegations are completely groundless and untrue,&quot; a spokesman for Yuen Foong Yu Paper Manufacturing Co Ltd told Reuters.</p>
<p>The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said on Monday it had arrested an employee of Yuen Foong Paper Co Ltd, a subsidiary of Yuen Foong Yu Paper Manufacturing, and a professor at Taiwan's National Chiao Tung University on charges relating to an alleged plan to steal trade secrets from Bristol-Myers.</p>
<p>The spokesman, who declined to be identified, said the company was interested in engaging in biotechnology ventures, but denied it intended to steal any trade secrets.</p>
<p>He said Yuen Foong was approached by a U.S. investment consulting firm, Mano Associated, to discuss possible technology cooperation.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no idea why our people were charged with being involved in the business spy case,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;Frankly, we do not know anything about the trade secrets related to Bristol-Myers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We have hired lawyers to investigate the case.&quot;</p>
<p>The FBI said in its arrest warrant and a news release that the two men conspired to illegally acquire, through an FBI undercover agent, plant cell culture technology used to make Taxol, a drug used to fight ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>Arrested were Kai-Lo Hsu, technical director of the Yuen Foong Paper in Taipei and Charles Ho, a professor at the National Chiao Tung University.</p>
<p>Ho was also described as a co-owner of a Delaware-registered biotechnology firm called Asiapharm.</p>
<p>The FBI said Hsu was charged with attempted theft of trade secrets, conspiracy to steal trade secrets and other violations. Ho was charged with aiding and abetting inter-state and foreign travel to commit bribery, and conspiracy.</p>
<p>At a court hearing on Monday afternoon, the two men were ordered held in advance of a bail hearing on Thursday, assistant U.S. attorney Richard Goldberg said.</p>
<p>Goldberg declined to comment when asked whether the paper company itself was a target in the investigation.</p>
