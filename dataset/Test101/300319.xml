<headline>Transcript of GM and VW letters.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-01-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Following are transcripts of letters sent between General Motors Corp and Volkswagen AG to end their nearly four-year-old legal dispute over allegations of industrial spying.</p>
<p>The two carmakers announced terms of the out-of-court settlement on Thursday. Both letters are dated January 9, 1997.</p>
<p>The settlement calls for VW to pay GM $100 million, buy some $1 billion worth of car parts over a seven-year period and retract statements made about the U.S. carmaker.</p>
<p>In return, GM has agreed to drop all civil litigation against VW, including its racketeering lawsuit filed in a Detroit federal court, which had threatened VW with a potential jury verdict payout in the billions of dollars.</p>
<p>VOLKSWAGEN LETTER TO GM:</p>
<p>Mr. John G. Smale</p>
<p>Member, Board of Directors</p>
<p>General Motors Corporation</p>
<p>Mr. John F. Smith Jr.</p>
<p>Chairman of the Board</p>
<p>General Motors Corporation</p>
<p>Gentlemen:</p>
<p>This letter is part of our agreement to settle the civil disputes between Volkswagen AG on one side and General Motors Corporation and Adam Opel AG on the other side.</p>
<p>We confirm that Volkswagen has accepted the resignation of Messrs. Lopez and Gutierrez as of November 29, 1996. Messrs. Alvarez and Piazza will resign or take administrative leave no later than by the end of January 1997.</p>
<p>The indictment of Messrs. Lopez, Gutierrez, Alvarez and Piazza brought by the Darmstadt prosecutor in December 1996 alleges illegal activities which are presently in front of a German court. Therefore, Volkswagen acknowledges the possibility that illegal activities by the individuals may have occurred. These allegations remain to be proven or disproven.</p>
<p>Volkswagen understands GM/Opel's concerns with respect to possible wrongdoing by the indicted individuals. Volkswagen also respects, however, the constitutional right of these individuals to be considered innocent until proven guilty.</p>
<p>You have informed us that GM/Opel's commencement of legal actions or public statements were not designed to harm Volkswagen's image or to defame Volkswagen or its executives. We accept this clarification and rescind any statements we have made to the contrary.</p>
<p>Volkswagen regrets any statements that have been interpreted to suggest that GM/Opel had planted or fabricated evidence. We do not believe that GM/Opel's actions constituted an attack on Germany as an industrial location.</p>
<p>Volkswagen is pleased that this letter and the actions taken allow us to bring the civil disputes to an end. We regret, as we understand GM does, that there has been such a public escalation of our disputes. The agreement reached between GM/Opel and Volkswagen creates future business opportunities for both sides, while remaining competitors in the automotive industry.</p>
<p>Signed</p>
<p>Dr Klaus Liesen</p>
<p>Dr Ferdinand Piech</p>
<p>GM LETTER TO VOLKSWAGEN</p>
<p>Dr Klaus Liesen</p>
<p>Chairman, Board of Supervisors</p>
<p>Volkswagen AG</p>
<p>Dr Ferdinand Piech</p>
<p>Chairman, Board of Management</p>
<p>Volkswagen AG</p>
<p>Gentlemen:</p>
<p>This letter responds to the letter you have sent us as part of our agreement to settle and resolve the civil disputes which our management has had with Volkswagen's management over the Lopez affair.</p>
<p>It is regrettable, as you indicate, that this dispute between our companies escalated to such a great degree. Circumstances required that we avail ourselves of the United States civil law causes of action. We have directed our counsel to dismiss the charges made against Dr Piech and Dr Neumann and, pursuant to the terms of our agreement, to dismiss our complaint against the rest of the defendants as well.</p>
<p>Our civil complaint against Volkswagen and some of your executives did not constitute criminal charges. We will continue to cooperate fully with the public prosecutors as requested by them. General Motors and Opel necessarily will abide by and respect the judgements of the prosecutors and the outcome of their investigations and proceedings.</p>
<p>We are pleased that Volkswagen has acknowledged the legitimacy of our concerns and that our companies have found a satisfactory basis for the resolution of our outstanding civil disputes. We look forward to a future unencumbered by the legacy of this matter.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>John G. Smale</p>
