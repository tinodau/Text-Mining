<p>Former U.S. Navy intelligence employee Robert Kim, accused of espionage for passing classified information to South Korea last year, is expected to plead guilty, the Justice Department said on Monday.</p>
<p>A department spokesman said a court hearing has been set for Wednesday in Alexandria, Virginia, for Kim to enter his guilty plea. A court official confirmed the hearing has been scheduled for the entering of the guilty plea.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury indicted Kim on three espionage counts in March, charging that he gave or attempted to give seven documents relating to the U.S. national defence to a South Korean official.</p>
<p>Kim, 56, who had been a civilian computer specialist with the Navy since 1978, had access to top-secret information during his military career. The Korean-born Kim became a U.S. citizen in 1974.</p>
<p>He initially pleaded not guilty to the charges and a trial had been planned for July. Details of the plea deal were not immediately available. The espionage charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole.</p>
<p>Kim was arrested in September at a diplomatic reception at Fort Myer, Virginia and charged with passing classified information to South Korean Navy Capt. Baek Dong-Il, who worked at the South Korean embassy.</p>
<p>Kim has remained in jail without bail since his arrest. He was dismissed from the Navy after his arrest.</p>
