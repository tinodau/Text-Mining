<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Friday.</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE 100 index closed lower but off the day's worst levels and with a net gain of 46.4 points on the week, despite the market's fixation with next Wednesday's UK Budget. The FTSE 100 closed at 4,640.3, down 17.6 points, or 0.38 percent.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Shares flagged, ending slightly lower after a week that saw the market set fresh records on the back of a liquidity upsurge, despite alarming see-sawing on Wall Street. The DAX-30 index closed at 3,795.41, down 9.88 points, or 0.26 percent. A rise of 7.14 on the week. In later screen-based trade the IBIS DAX index ended at 3,809.92, down 10.24 points, or 0.27 percent.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 share index ended a touch weaker, retracing most of the day's losses, and clinging just below the key 2,900 level. The CAC-40 index closed at 2,891.04, down 2.60 points, or 0.09 percent, a rise of 133.94 from last week.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Shares rebounded from opening losses to post a third straight record close after the index rose on the back of gains in the financials sector. The Swiss market index closed at 5,700.3, up 30.4 points, or 0.54 percent and up 138.5 points on the week.</p>
<p>MILAN - Stocks ended slightly easier but off the day's lows after a quiet pre-weekend session as the market paused for breath after soaring earlier in the week. The All Share Mibtel index closed at 13,388, down 19 points, or 0.14 percent, up 203 points on the week.</p>
<p>AMSTERDAM - Shares ended marginally lower, getting a late boost from a firm opening on Wall Street which pushed the AEX index up from an off early dip. The AEX index closed at 870.45, down 0.18 points, or 0.02 percent. There was a rise of 8.25 from last week.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Stocks closed lower after a brief rally prompted by stronger-than-expected growth in Japan's industrial production in May fizzled out due to caution on the peak day for annual shareholders' meetings, brokers said. The 225-share Nikkei average closed at 20,523.75, down 101.01 points, or 0.49 percent. This was up 138.21 from last Friday.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - The Hang Seng Index ended the last day of trading under colonial rule at a record closing high but its gains paled in comparison to the red chips which were bid sharply higher ahead of a new era under China. The Hang Seng index closed at 15,196.79, up 68.77 points, or 0.45 percent. A rise of 42.43 points on the week.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Shares ended marginally higher with options expiries dominating trade and market heavyweight BHP's annual profit well received by investors. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,702.4, up 2.5 points, or 0.09 percent, a fall of 10.2 from the previous Friday's close.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - Industrial and all-share indices finished at record highs in heavy volumes on continued positive sentiment, but the gold index tumbled to its lowest since March, 1993. The All-share index closed at 7,411.2, up 8.5 points, or 0.11 percent, up 177.1 from a week ago. The All Gold index closed at 994.8, down 13.6 points, or 0.06 percent, a drop of 32.6 since last week. While the Industrial index closed at 8,747.6, up 5.3 points, or 1.35 percent. This was up 236.1 from last Friday.</p>
