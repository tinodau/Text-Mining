<title>GERMANY: German court conceals decision in Lopez case.</title>
<headline>German court conceals decision in Lopez case.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-11-22</dateline>

<p>A Frankfurt appellate court took a decision on Friday on handing over German prosecution documents on Volkswagen AG to the U.S. Justice Department but declined to publicise it until next week.</p>
<p>Court spokesman Wolfgang Frank said the decision was being sent to the parties involved before being made public.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has asked for documents on VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and other suspects in a legal fight against VW's rival, Opel AG.</p>
<p>Lopez, a Spaniard, is being probed by German authorities for allegedly taking along secret documents when he quit Opel and parent company General Motors Corp in 1993 to join VW.</p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors began an investigation shortly after Lopez and three of his associates joined VW and made the request for the German documents more than two years ago.</p>
<p>Court spokesman Wolfgang Frank said the decision was being sent to the parties involved before being made public.</p>
<p>VW has fought the document transfer by saying the rights of Lopez and other suspects would be violated and that German courts should have jurisdiction over the overall issue.</p>
<p>Lopez's German lawyer said earlier in November that he expected German prosecutors in Darmstadt to soon file criminal charges related to industrial spying against his client. Prosecutors have said a decision would be made by year-end.</p>
<p>If the Frankfurt court complies with the U.S. request for the information, the files could be put before a U.S. grand jury in Detroit, the hometown of GM, that is also investigating the abrupt switch of Lopez and other executives to Volkswagen.</p>
<p>VW has suffered a series of legal setbacks in recent weeks, including a U.S. district court in Detroit rejecting VW's attempts to have the lawsuit -- which includes racketeering charges based on organised crime statutes -- dismissed.</p>
<p>In addition to Lopez, the U.S. lawsuit filed by GM names, among others, VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech.</p>
<p>The Detroit federal court is scheduled to issue a written decision by November 26 on the inclusion of the racketeering charges, which are based on RICO statutes initially used to fight the Mafia and whose use has been expanded.</p>
<p>Legal experts familiar with U.S. civil lawsuits said GM getting a U.S. jury verdict in its favour on racketeering charges could see the carmaker facing hefty damages.</p>
