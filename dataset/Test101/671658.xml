<p>European Union transport ministers agreed on Wednesday to force ferry operators to record details of passengers and crew carried on longer voyages so as to help rescue services in the event of accidents.</p>
<p>Under the new rules, ferries sailing from EU ports will have to count passengers and crews on short trips and register the names, gender and age bracket of passengers and crew on voyages of more than 20 nautical miles.</p>
<p>The move is intended to help rescue services target their search efforts, giving them the information they need to know whether people remain to be saved.</p>
<p>&quot;When we remind ourselves that it took two whole days in the wake of the sinking of the 'Herald of Free Enterprise' to discover how many people had been lost and who they were, we can only begin to imagine the appalling experience of families,&quot; European Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock said.</p>
<p>He was referring to the 1987 accident involving a ferry which capsized and sank outside the Belgian port of Zeebrugge after leaving harbour with its bow doors open.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopefully, in the event of such tragedies, no one will have to go through that experience again,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Kinnock said the new rules would require registration of passengers and crew on all cross-Channel ferry routes.</p>
<p>The European Commission has said lists are essential for the identification of those people killed or injured in an accident and for the treatment of legal issues related to dependants' insurance and inheritance rights.</p>
<p>Italy secured a derogation for its busy ferry route across the Straits of Messina, allowing it to set figures for passenger numbers by adding together the maximum capacity of the railway wagons and other vehicles carried instead of by counting heads.</p>
<p>The measures, which still require final European parliamentary approval, are set to come into force on the last day of 1999, 18 months later than originally proposed.</p>
<p>Wednesday's decision leaves outstanding the other issue raised by the Zeebrugge disaster, and by the later and more murderous &quot;Estonia&quot; ferry sinking in 1994, the question of ferry instability in case of flooding on vehicle decks.</p>
<p>Kinnock said progress with ferry design was on the way via an international deal struck in Stockholm, though some disagree.</p>
<p>British Labour Euro-MP Mark Watts said in a Reuters interview last March that more should be done.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the 'Estonia' sank we have had the Stockholm agreement on maritime safety, but even that does not go far enough because it does not insist on the fundamental design changes that were proposed after the 'Herald' sank,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ministers also agreed on Wednesday to a revision of rules on the training and certification of seafarers.</p>
