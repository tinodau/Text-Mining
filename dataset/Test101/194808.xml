<headline>Egypt to issue spy charge sheet against Israeli.</headline>
<dateline>CAIRO 1996-11-16</dateline>

<p>Egypt will issue an official charge sheet next week against an Israeli man and an Egyptian citizen accused of spying, a public prosecution source said on Saturday.</p>
<p>He said the prosecutor had questioned Azam Azam, an Israeli of Arab origin, and Egyptian national Emad eddin Abdel Hamid and would issue the charge sheet detailing the accusation on Monday or Tuesday.</p>
<p>The source said Israeli embassy officials could visit Azam and he could have the lawyers he requested.</p>
<p>Egyptian security sources have said Hamid confessed to spying for Israel and receiving spying equipment. Israel said Azam, 35, was innocent and demanded his release.</p>
<p>Azam, chief mechanic at an Israeli-owned textile factory in Egypt, was arrested last week by Egyptian security authorities along with Hamid. Egyptian newspapers said they were accused of several charges, including espionage.</p>
<p>Egypt in 1979 became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel.</p>
