<headline>German shares start firmer as dollar strengthens.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-11-28</dateline>

<p>German shares received an early boost on Thursday when the dollar raced up to its highest level for a month against the mark, boosting German exporting stocks in particular.</p>
<p>The DAX index of 30 leading shares touched a day's high of 2,816.63 points in early trade, just below its all-time record high of 2,819.95 points, before paring gains slightly to stand up 16.43 points, or 0.59 percent at 2,813.46 by 1024 GMT.</p>
<p>The dollar penetrated the crucial 1.53 mark level, after the Bank of France monetary policy council member Jean-Pierre Gerard said he wanted a stronger dollar against the mark.</p>
<p>Before the dollar rally, dealers had been expecting the DAX to take a breather before making a fresh assault on its record highs, with business likely to be dampened by Thanksgiving holiday in U.S.</p>
<p>They said the effect was likely to be particularly noticable in the afternoon, when the German market could miss inspiration from the U.S. markets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile shares in Europe's biggest carmaker Volkswagen AG recovered slightly after a newspaper report that its production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua was likely to offer his resignation.</p>
<p>Sources close to the company said he was expected to resign from his post on Friday.</p>
<p>Lopez is at the centre of a VW legal battle with Opel, a unit of U.S. giant General Motors, over alleged industrial espionage charges.</p>
<p>VW shares recovered 14.20 marks to 615.50 marks in bourse trade, after slipping six percent on Wednesday on worries that VW may face bigger damages than previously expected.</p>
<p>But dealers said if no settlement was reached in the next few days then VW shares could slip below the 600 mark level. One dealer said that if Lopez resigned, that could be taken by the market as an admission of guilt and could also damage the stock.</p>
<p>Meanwhile shares in national airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG gained over one percent, climbing 20 pfennigs to 19.95 marks, after reporting a decline in pre-tax profits for the first nine months of the year, but predicting an improvement next year.</p>
