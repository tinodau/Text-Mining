<headline>VW's Piech says he won't apologize to GM. [CORRECTED 18:56 GMT]</headline>

<p>Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech said Tuesday that he will resist General Motors Corp.'s demand that he apologise over allegations that VW obtained GM corporate secrets when it hired a top executive away from the Detroit carmaker.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not expect they will wring it (an apology) out of me,&quot; Piech said on German television Tuesday.</p>
<p>Piech said Monday that he had the &quot;deepest regrets&quot; for the events surrounding VW's bitter dispute with GM over the transfer of former GM production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua to VW in March 1993.</p>
<p>However, he stopped well short of confessing any wrongdoing by VW -- a demand set by GM before it would consider any out-of-court settlement to its U.S. civil lawsuit that charges VW and top officials with racketeering.</p>
<p>Piech said a new round of talks with GM could begin by year-end and that other companies were acting as intermediaries to help end the dispute, which some auto industry officials have said could endanger German-U.S. trade relations.</p>
<p>The VW chief said he hoped a deal could soon be reached with GM and that he wanted a new round of talks to begin after a third attempt in London in September failed.</p>
<p>But Piech added fuel to the battle, telling Germany's Stern magazine in an interview this week that &quot;we have at the moment the better cars and General Motors the better lawyers.&quot;</p>
<p>He also warned GM to expect a lengthy legal fight, one that &quot;in the end will have no winners&quot; and may cost GM more in Germany than it would VW in the United States, since GM has a stronger presence in Europe than VW has in North America.</p>
<p>Piech also told Stern he knew GM wanted him out at VW, saying, &quot;I have said to my supervisory board from the beginning that this does not involve Lopez but instead really me.&quot;</p>
<p>GM has long demanded that VW apologise before it would consider any settlement to its U.S. lawsuit, which could leave VW facing a jury verdict for billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Other demands set out by GM include that VW sever all ties with Lopez (corrects from &quot;sever all ties with GM&quot;) and that VW agree to pay for damages. Lopez resigned from the VW management board Nov. 29 but GM officials were incensed that VW appointed a Lopez protege to the job.</p>
<p>The Detroit autormaker contends Lopez used the data from GM to cut VW's costs by about 700 million German marks (about $450 million), quickly eroding a 20 percent cost advantage that GM's German unit Opel had over VW, the largest carmaker in Europe.</p>
<p>Stern magazine said Tuesday that the VW supervisory board has given Piech, the grandson of VW founder Ferdinand Porsche, until year-end to settle the lawsuit or he could risk not having his contract renewed when it expires next year.</p>
<p>A VW spokesman declined to comment on the report.</p>
<p>Also Tuesday, sources said German prosecutors would file lesser-than-expected criminal charges involving embezzlement and betrayal against Lopez and some of the colleagues who followed him from GM to VW.</p>
<p>The sources said the charges would not include more serious allegations involving fraud, which can carry a jail term of five to 10 years.</p>
<p>The expected charges against Lopez are punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine, but first-time offenders do not usually face prison time, according to legal experts.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Lopez's lawyer declined to comment.</p>
