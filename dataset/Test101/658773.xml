<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Friday.</p>
<p>LONDON - The UK's FTSE 100 index was driven to its third record close this week by the U.S. stock market's seemingly unstoppable rise and by fresh domestic bid activity which helped boost investor confidence. The FTSE 100 closed at 4,783.1, up 25.7 points, or 0.54 percent. This was up 161.80 from last Friday.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Equities ended trade at a record closing high, lifted by Wall Street's strongest bull run in history and after a firm dollar propelled the equity market higher. The DAX-30 index closed at 3,744.44, up 36.45 points, or 0.98 percent. This was up 49.15 on the week. In later screen-based trade the IBIS DAX index ended at 3,752.37, up 15.21 points, or 0.41 percent.</p>
<p>PARIS - Friday the 13th proved lucky for the Paris bourse, which surged 1.75 percent to close at an all-time closing high. Traders said comments from the German-French summit, which made progress on a European Union budget stability pact, helped push up the market, which earlier hit a session high of 2,811.86 before retracing. The market was also buoyed by weak U.S. producer prices data and the bull run on Wall Street. The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 48.25 points, or 1.75 percent, at 2,808.52, a rise of 89.27 from last week.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Shares ended a mixed session at a record level although the blue-chip SMI index failed to overcome resistance at 5,400. Dealers said Wall Street's firm opening gave the market a late push higher. The Swiss market index closed at 5,384.6, up 20.4 points, or 0.38 percent, and up 80 points on the week.</p>
<p>MILAN - Shares closed higher in a flurry of across-the-board buying, spurred by hopes of a breakthough in agreeing an EMU stability pact and U.S. data conveying a picture of non-inflationary growth. The All Share Mibtel index closed at 12,761, up 292 points, or 2.33 percent, up 484 points on the week.</p>
<p>AMSTERDAM - Shares closed at a record high, the seventh in the last 10 trading sessions, boosted by a surge on Wall Street following U.S. Producer Price data which pointed to tame inflation. The AEX index closed at 846.09, up 6.73 points, or 0.80 percent, or up 21.66 points on the week.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Stocks ended the session marginally lower. Morning gains on the June futures and options settlement lifted the benchmark to a new high for calendar 1997, but it later melted on profit-taking ahead of the weekend. The 225-share Nikkei average closed at 20,528.35, down 36.11 points, or 0.18 percent. This was 42.60 down from last Friday.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Stocks closed higher following volatile trade, with the Hang Seng Index recovering some of Thursday's sharp losses after finding support at the 13,800 level in morning trade, brokers said. The Hang Seng index closed at 14,112.55, up 188.21 points, or 1.35 percent, a drop of 542.58 points on the week.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Shares capped a strong week with a record close, the market healthy enough to absorb profit-taking on News Corp and bank stocks which posted strong gains on Thursday. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,655.3, up 17.2 points, or 0.65 percent, a rise of 54.4 from the previous Friday's close.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - Shares ended flat in listless trade, but a swathe of overnight foreign assets swaps boostd volumes as Gencor closed with 4.1 million shares traded on the counter, dealers said. The All-share index closed at 7,271.5, down 21.2 points, or 0.29 percent, up 9.3 from a week ago. The All Gold index closed at 1,129.0, down 19.1 points, or 0.23 percent, a drop of 46.6 since last week. The Industrial index closed at 8,482.4, down 19.7 points, or 1.66 percent, a rise of 5.7 from last Friday.</p>
