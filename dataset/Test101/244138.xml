<headline>VW's Piech says regrets confusion,costs from Lopez.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-12-09</dateline>

<p>Volkswagen AG chief executive Ferdinand Piech said on Monday he regreted the trouble, costs and confusion to General Motors Corp over the transfer of some GM executives to VW in March 1993 who face allegations of industrial spying.</p>
<p>Piech also told journalists at a VW event in Colmar, Germany, that the transfer of the executive at the centre of the dispute, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, to VW was legal.</p>
<p>He also said talks to settle a U.S. civil court lawsuit filed by GM in Detroit alleging VW and its top executives with racketeering would likely resume after German prosecutors file charges in the coming weeks against Lopez.</p>
<p>In addition, Piech said payment for damages was the least important point in prior settlement talks with GM.  </p>
<p>VW said earlier on Monday that Piech would express his &quot;deepest regrets&quot; to GM in an interview to be published on Thursday in Germany's mass-circulation Stern magazine.</p>
<p>Piech's comments appear to be an attempt to de-escalate the tension with GM and its German subsidiary, Adam Opel AG, to allegations that Lopez and seven other GM executives who followed him to VW took along thousands of secret documents.</p>
<p>GM has laid out three conditions to VW before it would consider any deal on its U.S. lawsuit -- which could leave VW facing a ruling in the billions of marks -- that VW sever all ties with Lopez, that VW issue an apology and pay for damages.</p>
<p>Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, resigned from VW in late November but Piech has said he would be happy to work with Lopez as a consultant. In addition, VW has agreed to pay him four million marks ($2.6 million) for the balance of his contract, which has incensed GM executives.</p>
