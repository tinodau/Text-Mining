<p>In another high-profile industrial espionage case, Dow Chemical Co. Tuesday filed a lawsuit charging General Electric Co. with pirating trade secrets from Dow's automotive plastics business.</p>
<p>Dow's complaint, filed in Oakland County Circuit Court in Pontiac, Mich., alleged that GE systematically and aggressively targeted, recruited and hired 14 Dow employees who were privy to Dow trade secrets.</p>
<p>Dow said GE put the employees into jobs where they would inevitably use confidential information on Dow's advances in automotive plastics technology.</p>
<p>The suit seeks substantial unspecified monetary damages and a permanent injunction that would, among other things, prevent GE from any activity that using Dow's information.</p>
<p>Oakland County Circuit Judge Edward Sosnick issued a temporary restraining order to that effect against GE shortly after the suit was filed.</p>
<p>The order, which needs confirmation at an April 9 hearing, prohibits GE from recruiting new Dow employees and from destroying any records about the 14 ex-Dow employees. It also requires GE to return any Dow documents the employees brought to GE and to give Darin Evans -- the only ex-Dow employee named as a defendant in the suit -- a new job where he would not be in a position to use any Dow secrets.</p>
<p>At the heart of the suit is Dow's expertise in designing and integrating complex plastic components such as car and truck instrument panels. It maintains its superior technological know-how earned it lucrative contracts to provide the plastics used in the instrument panels for Chrysler Corp.'s new Dodge Dakota pickup truck and Jeep Cherokee sport utility vehicle.</p>
<p>&quot;We're filing this suit because we believe that GE is breaking the law,&quot; said Dow automotive president Larry Denton. &quot;GE was unable to duplicate our advances in automotive technology so they set out to raid our workforce in order to loot our trade secrets.&quot;</p>
<p>Dow and GE are bitter rivals in the growing market for high-tech plastics that allow automakers to reduce vehicle weight and cost and improve styling and performance.</p>
<p>GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., said it would comply with the restraining order, but will vigorously fight the lawsuit.</p>
<p>&quot;GE respects the value and importance of trade secrets. We have reviewed Dow's allegations and find them to be groundless and without merit,&quot; GE spokesman Bruce Bunch said. &quot;GE has not obtained any Dow Chemical trade secrets.&quot;</p>
<p>Bunch added that Evans, the defendant, was in a non-supervisory engineering job and only has about five years of experience.</p>
<p>The dispute comes about three months after General Motors Corp. reached a $1.1 billion settlement with Volkswagen AG that ended a long-running dispute over GM's allegations that Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and his followers stole GM trade secrets when they abruptly left GM to join VW in 1993.</p>
<p>Lopez, who had served as GM's purchasing chief, resigned as VW's production chief in November 1996 and is facing criminal charges in Germany.</p>
<p>In a link between the two cases, Dow has hired Eugene Driker, one of the main lawyers GM used in its now-settled civil racketeering lawsuit against VW.</p>
<p>Driker said Tuesday that Dow will seek substantial damages from GE in a jury trial because the trade secrets could allow GE to quickly catch up to Dow's level of expertise with far less expense.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very hard to assess the valuation of a secret that's disclosed to a competitor where that competitor can avoid going down blind alleys, avoiding mistakes that you've made and go for the gold based upon your own trade secret,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dow is not seeking a criminal probe of GE's actions, Driker said. Dow gave GE nearly a month to rectify the situation before the civil suit was filed, but he said GE took no corrective actions.</p>
