<p>A Mongolian court has ruled that former espionage chief General J. Baatar was not guilty of illegally spying on opposition party leaders, judges said on Monday.</p>
<p>A closed-door court session decided last week that Baatar, former chief of the Centre for Espionage, was not guilty of misusing his position or ordering illegal spying activities.</p>
<p>&quot;After examining the charges of ordering illegal spying and misuse of position, our court decided he was not guilty,&quot; judge Minjirmaa of the Chingeltei district court told Reuters.</p>
<p>The court gave no details of the session that ended late on Friday, saying it was a state secret.</p>
<p>&quot;There were no documents nor any witnesses against me,&quot; Baatar, who now works as a government expert in strategic leadership, said in an interview. &quot;The accusations were merely political.&quot;</p>
<p>Baatar was dismissed last December, only a few months after he was appointed by the new Democratic Union Coalition Prime Minister M. Enkhsaikhan, after a parliamentary committee said it found evidence of illegal surveillance on opposition party leaders.</p>
<p>The committee said the Centre had bugged the telephones of the ex-communist Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP), which was unseated in general elections in June, 1996.</p>
<p>Members of parlament have said those abuses were only a part of a larger pattern of illegal activities by the Centre that began well before the MPRP was unseated in the elections.</p>
<p>The Centre for Espionage was dismantled last December and replaced by the Centre for National Security.</p>
