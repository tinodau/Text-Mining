<p>Volkswagen AG suffered another setback in its legal fight against General Motors Corp after a lawyer said on Friday he expected the top VW executive at the centre of the brawl to face criminal charges in Germany.</p>
<p>The lawyer, Juergen Taschke, who represents embattled VW purchasing executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, said he expected German prosecutors to file charges of industrial spying against his client by the end of this month.</p>
<p>Taschke said in a statement he &quot;still expected in November&quot; that charges would be filed against Lopez, a former GM global executive who allegedly took along secret company documents when he abruptly quit in 1993 to join the VW board.</p>
<p>Taschke's acknowledgement of the pending charges was the latest blow for VW, which has recently lost two major court battles against Detroit-based GM in lawsuits in the U.S. and Germany involving Lopez.</p>
<p>A German judge on October 30 dismissed a lawsuit by VW that sought 10 million marks ($6.62 million) in damages from Opel and GM for allegedly defaming the carmaker at company news conferences.</p>
<p>And a U.S. district court judge in Detroit on October 16 also rejected a move by VW lawyers to have GM's civil lawsuit, which was filed in frustration at the lack of progress in the German criminal investigation, dismissed.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Frankfurt prosecutors' office said on Friday a decision would be made by the end of the year on whether to file charges against Lopez, bringing to an end a criminal investigation that has lasted more than three years.</p>
<p>Lopez, a Basque, has been renowned for his ability to streamline production and cut carmaking costs, established innovative working practices at the Wolfsburg-based carmaker that have helped VW return to profitabilty.</p>
<p>VW, which has vehemently denied allegations against Lopez and other top officials made by GM and its German unit Opel, declined comment on Taschke's statements.</p>
<p>Taschke issued the statement after he told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Friday he expected Lopez and three other VW workers to face industrial spying charges.</p>
<p>The three other VW executives in the German criminal probe, identified as Jose Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez and Rosario Piazza, left Opel shortly after Lopez defected to VW and joined the German carmaker's management board, he said.</p>
<p>The German charges will relate to allegations that Lopez and others took secret plans related to the design of a new super-efficient manufacturing plan called &quot;Plant X&quot; that GM had under development, Taschke told the newspaper.</p>
<p>GM, in waging a nearly four-year legal battle in the U.S. and Germany against VW, has alleged that VW used the secret information and other confidential data to build a new production plant in Brazil.</p>
<p>The latest legal defeat also comes at a difficult time for the carmaker with the publication this week of a company history revealing sordid details of its former Nazi links and the use of Third Reich slave labour.</p>
<p>VW this week warned rivals not to use the book as negative advertising against it, saying it felt a moral responsibility to shed light on the dark chapter of its corporate history.</p>
<p>VW sources said they had expected that the charges would be filed against Lopez but that there were no immediate plans for him to be pushed out of the carmaker.</p>
<p>&quot;Lopez is not going to be dumped,&quot; one VW official said.</p>
<p>But a German car industry executive said a decision on Lopez's future could be made at an upcoming supervisory board meeting scheduled sometime in the next two weeks. ($1=1.5104 Mark)</p>
