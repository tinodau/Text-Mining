<p>An Egyptian state security court will this month pass its verdict on an Israeli man and his alleged Egyptian accomplice on charges they spied on Egypt for the Jewish state.</p>
<p>Maharram Darwish, the main judge in a session of the trial held at a Cairo state security court on Monday, said he would hand down the verdict on August 31.</p>
<p>Israeli Druze textile technician Azam Azam and Egyptian Emad Abdelhalim Ismail are charged with making criminal arrangements to spy for the Israeli intelligence service Mossad.</p>
<p>The case has brought Egypt-Israeli ties to one of their lowest points since their 1979 peace treaty.</p>
<p>Two women -- Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna -- are on trial in absentia on the same charges. Like Azam, they are also members of the Druze community.</p>
<p>The trial, which started on April 24, resumed on Sunday and continued on Monday. Azam's lawyer, Farid el-Deeb, tried to prove his client's innocence by saying that there was no evidence to support Ismail's espionage charge.</p>
<p>Among the charges against Ismail was that he accepted a bribe to spy for Mossad. &quot;He took $400, $100 and $150, but only to help him in his living,&quot; Deeb said.</p>
<p>But the defence for Ismail had said in an earlier session that there was no proof his client took money.</p>
<p>Ismail is also charged with providing information on Egypt's industry to Mossad. Deeb argued in Monday's hearing that such information was publicly available and presented to the judge a copy of the business directory Kompass on Egypt.</p>
<p>He said any talk between Ismail and Greiss, who is charged with trying to recruit him, was normal conversation.</p>
<p>&quot;Such a case is harmful to Egypt. Egypt is so strong and deeply rooted to be hurt by a normal conversation,&quot; Deeb said.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Hisham Badawi asked for the maximum punishment for the defendants, saying they deserved no mercy.</p>
<p>Lawyers say Ismail faces 25 years in jail with hard labour. Azam faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, lawyers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We trust your just verdict, for which millions of people are waiting,&quot; Badawi told the court.</p>
