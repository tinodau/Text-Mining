<headline>Opel sources deny settlement in Lopez-VW case.</headline>

<p>Officials at General Motors Corp.'s German subsidiary denied Sunday that the companies were close to settling a 3-1/2-year-old dispute with Volkswagen AG over alleged industrial espionage.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no settlement negotiations,&quot; said an official at Adam Opel AG, the German subsidiary, denying a report in the magazine Der Spiegel that a settlement had been drawn up by top managers from both sides and was awaiting GM approval.</p>
<p>GM maintains that former executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who resigned on Friday from VW, stole GM secrets when he defected to VW in 1993. A VW plant in Brazil, whose construction Lopez supervised, is said to draw strongly on earlier plans by Opel for a &quot;Plant X.&quot;</p>
<p>VW officials declined to comment Sunday.</p>
<p>VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech said on Friday that the two sides had met three times to discuss a settlement.</p>
<p>The Opel sources, who declined to be named, said the fact that Piech suggested Lopez could continue to work as a consultant for VW could delay the settlement VW seeks.</p>
<p>VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen on Friday praised Lopez's performance and said VW would meet its obligations under his contract, which ran through March 1998.</p>
<p>German media reports said Lopez would receive from 4 million German marks ($2.6 million) to 11 million marks ($7.2 million) in compensation.</p>
<p>VW could face penalties totalling billions of dollars in a suit brought by GM in the United States. A U.S. judge said last week that GM could pursue its complaint under U.S. racketeering laws, which means GM could ask for triple damages in the case.</p>
<p>A &quot;status conference&quot; in the case is scheduled for Tuesday, where lawyers for the two sides will outline their plans for further proceedings.</p>
<p>The Opel source said the judge was likely to ask at that session about the prospects for an out-of-court settlement. GM lawyers are likely to repeat their standing position that there are no ongoing settlement negotiations.</p>
<p>GM has publicly set three conditions for a settlement: Lopez's departure from VW, a public apology, and a financial settlement.</p>
<p>Opel officials have said that Lopez's resignation was a diversionary tactic that does not satisfy the first of GM's conditions for a settlement.</p>
<p>Spiegel reported that Liesen and Lower Saxony state premier Gerhard Schroeder had drawn up a proposed out-of-court settlement with GM executive committee chairman John Smale. Lower Saxony is VW's largest shareholder.</p>
<p>Spiegel reported that now that Lopez has left VW, Smale had signalled GM might soften its other demands for an apology and a financial settlement.</p>
<p>The proposed deal included a commitment by VW to buy GM parts, but Smale's plan had opponents within GM who were insisting the case go to court, the magazine said.</p>
<p>Lopez was reported to be at home in Spain, resting and concentrating on his defence in the case.</p>
