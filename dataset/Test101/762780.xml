<p>Japanese police have issued an arrest warrant for a Russian who posed as a Japanese national for the last 30 years in order to spy, Japanese news reports said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Metropolitan Police issued the warrant for the Russian, who is described as being of Asian descent, according to Japan's Tokyo Broadcasting System and the national Kyodo news service.</p>
<p>The police are asking that an international arrest warrant be issued as well, the reports said.</p>
<p>The suspect was alleged to have conducted political, economic and military espionage for more than 30 years for the former Soviet Union and then Russia, the reports said.</p>
<p>Kyodo quoted officials of the Metropolitan Police Department's Public Security Bureau as saying a Russian Embassy secretary who recently left Japan was involved in the scheme.</p>
<p>Police and Russian embassy officials were not available for comment on the reports.</p>
<p>The suspect, who worked at a Tokyo trading company, has been missing since he left for Beijing two years ago, TBS said in its report. The report did not explain why the case was now coming to light.</p>
<p>The suspect was wanted on suspicion of applying five years ago for a passport in the name of Ichiro Kuroba, a 67-year-old man who has been reported missing, TBS reported.</p>
<p>The reports said the suspect's house contained  espionage equipment such as wireless receivers and tables to decipher cryptograms.</p>
