<p>Volkswagen will seek Chancellor Helmut Kohl's help in trying to settle a dispute with General Motors Corp. over charges that the German automaker stole industrial secrets, senior VW officials told Spiegel magazine.</p>
<p>The weekly news magazine, made available ahead of Monday's edition, said VW Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech and supervisory board Chairman Klaus Liesen would approach Kohl in early January to request his mediation in the three-year-long conflict.</p>
<p>Spiegel quoted another supervisory board member, politician Otto Graff Lambsdorff, as calling for Kohl's intervention. &quot;Helmut Kohl must speak with (President) Bill Clinton,&quot; the Free Democrat told Spiegel.</p>
<p>GM is seeking huge damages under U.S. anti-racketeering laws over the alleged theft of secret information by Spanish purchasing boss Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who moved from GM's German unit Adam Opel AG to VW in 1993.</p>
<p>Lopez resigned from VW last week but has been invited by Piech to stay on as a consultant and his contract will be honoured through to 1998.</p>
<p>That has not been enough to satisfy the Detroit auto giant's demand for a complete severance of ties, a full apology, acceptance of responsibility for the damage to GM's business and the payment of out-of-court compensation.</p>
<p>Walter Leisler Kiep, another member of VW's supervisory board who initiated secret talks with GM in September on ending the dispute, told Bild am Sonntag newspaper there were &quot;realistic chances of an amicable agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>Kiep rejected the renewed demands by GM as &quot;completely unacceptable.&quot; He added that neither side had any interest in a legal battle which could run for years and &quot;could escalate into a battle of unimaginable proportions exceeding all the bounds of competition.</p>
<p>&quot;It could result in German-American relations suffering long-term damage, because both companies are national symbols.&quot;</p>
<p>The head of competing German automaker Mercedes, Helmut Werner, told Hannoversche Allgemeine newspaper the VW-GM row was &quot;good neither for German industry nor for German-U.S. relations.&quot;</p>
<p>He added there were good chances that VW's Piech would be able &quot;to clear up the situation.&quot; Mercedes is a unit of Daimler-Benz AG.</p>
<p>Kiep, a former senior official in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrat party (CDU) and ex-finance minister in Lower Saxony state -- where VW is based -- said he hoped to broker a further meeting between executives of the two companies.</p>
<p>He added that the meeting would depend on when German prosecutors open criminal proceedings in a separate case against Lopez over the industrial espionage allegations. That could happen as early as next week, he told Bild am Sonntag.</p>
