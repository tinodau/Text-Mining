<headline>German shares ends bourse up, Hoechst in spotlight.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-12-10</dateline>

<p>A reassuring overnight rebound on Wall Street, steady Bunds and a stable dollar helped the German share market post further gains in bourse dealings on Tuesday, with many dealers expecting the trend to continue.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index ended bourse trade up 33.76 points, 1.18 percent, at 2,891.00 points, climbing back close to the levels it had reached before Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan sent global markets tumbling on Friday with his warnings against excessive market exuberance.</p>
<p>By the end of floor trade on Tuesday the DAX had recouped almost all the four percent in value it lost on Friday and looked set to mount the crucial 2,900 point-level soon.</p>
<p>&quot;The market factors are all there,&quot; said one Frankfurt dealer. &quot;I think we are back on track.&quot;</p>
<p>Although some dealers said there was still a lot of nervousness in the market, a move past the 2,900 level, which the DAX had reached for the first time last week, should trigger renewed buying interest.</p>
<p>&quot;If we hit 2,900 points, then we will be chasing 3,000,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>The day's biggest DAX gainer was German chemicals and drugs group Hoechst AG, which jumped to record highs on Tuesday after the firm announced it would merge its speciality chemicals business with Swiss group Clariant AG.</p>
<p>Shares in Hoechst, which had been briefly suspended while the announcement was made, ended bourse dealings up 2.22 marks, or 3.2 percent, at 70.90 marks, earlier touching an all-time high of 71.20 marks.</p>
<p>Shares in other chemicals stocks also rose after the news, BASF AG ending bourse trade up 2.4 percent, or 1.48 marks at 62.18 marks, while Bayer also climbed 2.4 percent or 1.50 marks to 64.55 marks.</p>
<p>The ongoing feud between German carmaker Volkswagen AG and U.S. rival General Motors Corp was continuing to attract attention.</p>
<p>VW ended bourse dealings up nine marks at 612 after its chief executive Ferdinand Piech appeared to take a more conciliatory line by expressing regret over the cost and trouble caused to both sides by the feud.</p>
<p>VW has been embroiled in a battle with GM over alleged industrial espionage by Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, once a top level GM executive who transferred to VW in 1993. Lopez resigned from VW in late November.</p>
