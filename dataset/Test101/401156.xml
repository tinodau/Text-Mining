<title>USA: Delphi to market itself as electronics firm.</title>
<headline>Delphi to market itself as electronics firm.</headline>

<p>General Motors Corp.'s Delphi Automotive Systems unit wants to market itself to Wall Street in a possible initial public offering as primarily an electronics-driven parts firm, a Delphi official said Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;That's absolutely our objective,&quot; J.T. Battenberg, president of the unit, told reporters at the Society of Automotive engineers conference. He said a planned integration with Delco Electronics will take time, &quot;but that's certainly our objective.&quot;</p>
<p>Battenberg, a GM executive vice president, said the integration of electronics into Delphi's more traditional mechanical parts systems will speed up once Delco Electronics Corp. is fully merged into Delphi.</p>
<p>At the nation's premier auto supplier show here, Delphi is touting its electronics expertise over its metal-bending capabilities, showing off &quot;smart&quot; air bag systems, computerized vehicle control and anti-skid systems and complete interior and instrumentation systems.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look out (into the future), electronics is becoming very pervasive,&quot; Battenberg said.</p>
<p>GM has said previously that Kokomo, Ind.-based Delco, now a part of GM's Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiary, will become a seventh division of Delphi in connection with the $9.5 billion sale of Hughes' defence electronics business to Raytheon Co.</p>
<p>GM will consider offering 20 percent of the combined Delco-Delphi to the public at a future date.</p>
<p>Michael Burns, Delco Electronics' general manager, said he expects the integration process to be largely completed by the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p>Even before any approvals have been granted for the Raytheon deal, Delphi and Delco already are combining the way they approach customers.</p>
<p>Mercedes-Benz, for example, which once had Delphi and Delco calling on it separately, now will have one &quot;customer manager&quot; from the combined firms, Burns said.</p>
<p>But he declined to offer specifics on how the Delco and Delphi staffs would be combined or whether any of Delco's 31,000 worldwide jobs would be eliminated.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to try to maximize this enterprise in terms of growth, profitability and presence around the world,&quot; Burns said.</p>
<p>Battenberg said Delphi still considers eight of its 191 plants as &quot;troubled,&quot; but said GM's timetable for future public ownership in Delphi does not depend on repair of those operations.</p>
<p>Still, Battenberg said Delphi is working hard to turn around unprofitable plants, such as two Dayton, Ohio, brake plants that staged a costly strike last year.</p>
<p>&quot;They are not making money. They're troubled, and we're trying to fix them,&quot; Battenberg said, adding that &quot;everything is a possibility,&quot; including consolidation or closure.</p>
<p>Separately, Battenberg said Delphi is now working closely with German automaker Volkswagen AG to determine the composition of $1 billion worth of GM parts that VW has agreed to buy to settle the Lopez industrial espionage dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;We've normalised relations with Volkswagen,&quot; Battenberg said. It's pretty much business as usual.&quot;</p>
<p>VW agreed to buy an additional $1 billion worth of components from GM over the next seven years as a part of a deal to settle GM's lawsuit alleging that former VW production chief J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and others stole GM corporate secrets when they left GM to join VW in 1993.</p>
<p>Battenberg declined to discuss the types of parts that VW may buy. The German automaker now buys about $300 million worth of GM parts annually, including a large portion of automobile wiring harnesses.</p>
