<p>Ford Motor Co., moving to boost its manufacturing efficiency in Europe, Tuesday said it hired a top executive away from Volkswagen AG to be its new European production chief.</p>
<p>Ford said Rolf Zimmermann will take over the newly created position of general operations manager for European manufacturing on Aug. 18.</p>
<p>Zimmermann, 50, worked most of his career at General Motors Corp.'s Adam Opel AG unit in Ruesselsheim, Germany, before jumping to VW at the beginning of 1996.</p>
<p>Most recently, he served as president of VW Navarra S.A. in Pamplona, Spain, which builds the Polo subcompact and engines, and also was the chief production officer for Skoda, VW's Czech automotive unit.</p>
<p>At Ford, Zimmermann will be responsible for all of Ford's engine, transmission, body and assembly plants, and all manufacturing support functions in Europe. He also will oversee a number of facilities in North and South America and the Asia-Pacific region, Ford said.</p>
<p>For the first half of 1997, Ford's European automotive operations earned $262 million, down from $269 million for the first half of 1996. For all of 1996, Ford lost $291 million in Europe.</p>
<p>It is the first time Ford has put a single executive directly in charge of manufacturing in Europe.</p>
<p>In the past, the chairman of Ford of Europe was responsible for all European business functions, but the position was dissolved last year when Ford put all of its global automotive operations under the control of Jacques Nasser as part of the company's &quot;Ford 2000&quot; structure. Nasser is based at Ford's world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.</p>
<p>With offices in Dunton, England, and Cologne, Germany, Zimmermann will report to John Huston, Ford's U.S.-based chief of engine and transmission operations, and to W. Dale McKeehan, the U.S.-based head of vehicle assembly.</p>
<p>Zimmermann's biggest challenge will be to broaden Ford's production and supply base away from Germany and to reduce manufacturing costs to allow the automaker to better compete in a brutal pricing envornment, said Burnham Securities analyst David Healy.</p>
<p>If Ford fails to trim costs, it will lose market share and face further capacity reductions, Healy said, adding, &quot;Everybody in Europe is sort of sitting around waiting for the other guy to close plants.&quot;</p>
<p>Born in Opel's hometown of Ruesselsheim, Zimmermann joined GM in 1961 and managed the company's Zaragosa, Spain, plant in the 1980s before taking charge of the giant Opel plant in Ruesselsheim from 1992 to September 1995. He then briefly came to the United States to work in GM's Delphi Automotive Systems parts operations before joining VW in early 1996.</p>
<p>He went to work in VW's production operations at a time when Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua was still the German automaker's manufacturing chief -- and worked with Lopez at GM.</p>
<p>But both GM and Ford spokesmen tried to distance Zimmermann from the embattled Lopez, who was charged in Germany last December along with three associates with stealing GM corporate secrets when he and several other managers left GM to join VW in 1993.</p>
<p>&quot;He didn't have anything to do with Lopez,&quot; said Bert Serre, a Ford spokesman in Dearborn. &quot;We've hired a guy who has good experience and good background.&quot;</p>
<p>Lopez quit VW in November 1996. In January, VW cut a deal to end GM's U.S. civil racketeering suit over the allegations, agreeing to pay GM $100 million and buy $1 billion worth of GM parts over seven years.</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, analysts credit Lopez' manufacturing team with slashing VW's manufacturing costs by billions of dollars.</p>
