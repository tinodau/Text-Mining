<p>Romania on Thursday denied involvement in espionage against Switzerland after Berne said it had arrested a Swiss diplomat accused of spying for the former communist country.</p>
<p>&quot;The (Romanian) Foreign Intelligence Service (SIE) has not conducted and is not conducting any espionage activities against Switzerland,&quot; the SIE director, General Ioan Talpes, was quoted by the local news agency Mediafax as saying.</p>
<p>SIE is one of a dozen Romanian spy agencies created after the 1989 fall of communism in the Balkan country.</p>
<p>Its spy-catching counterpart, the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI), which replaced the dreaded Communist-era Securitate secret police, is the only intelligence body subordinated to parliament control.</p>
<p>Berne prosecutors said on Wednesday they had taken a Swiss diplomat into custody over accusations of handing over secret political and economic assessments to Romanian intelligence as well as information about people wanted by police.</p>
<p>The Swiss federal prosecutor's office said the diplomat had confessed to espionage.</p>
<p>Asked to comment on the diplomat's case, an official at the Romanian SRI's press office told Reuters:</p>
<p>&quot;The SRI has no links with foreign espionage, and even less so with spying against a friendly country.&quot;</p>
