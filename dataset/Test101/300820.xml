<p>Investors intensified their love affair with Volkswagen on Friday only hours after the German carmaker and U.S. rival General Motors settled their bitter dispute over allegations of industrial spying.</p>
<p>VW shares rose as much as two percent, reaching a new record high at 724.50 marks, and kept up their advance that has so far netted VW investors about 10 percent since Tuesday when speculation about a potential deal began to emerge.</p>
<p>Industry analysts said VW shares should keep up the advance in the near-term, propelled by the settlement late on Thursday of the row over allegations that former VW management board member Jose Ignacio Lopez stole secret documents when he left GM in 1993.</p>
<p>An additional factor is Volkswagen's outlook for future growth, they said.</p>
<p>VW has sorted out problems at subsidiaries in Spain and the Czech Republic and is seeking to expand in emerging markets such as South America and Asia, particularly in China, while increasing production volumes in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;This removes a major risk for VW,&quot; said one Frankfurt industry analyst.</p>
<p>&quot;I would only expect positive news from VW in the coming years. When you look at the fundamentals, their market share in western Europe is expected to rise at least through 1998 due to new products coming out in the new years,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>The settlement calls for VW to pay GM $100 million, buy some $1 billion worth of GM car parts over a seven-year period and retract statements made about the U.S. carmaker. VW now buys about $300 million in GM parts each year, the majority of which are electrical wiring harnesses for cars.</p>
<p>In return, GM has agreed to drop all civil litigation against VW, including its racketeering lawsuit filed in a Detroit federal court, which had threatened VW with a potential jury damages verdict in the billions of dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;It's an incredibily clever deal but also sensible for both partners to end this fight,&quot; said Peter Schmidt at Automotive Industry Data in Britain. &quot;This fight seemed from the beginning like two children fighting over sweets.&quot;</p>
<p>Schmidt said the settlement will allow both carmakers to focus on their businesses at a time of difficult industry conditions in Europe, where overcapacity and economic worries are dampening car sales, as well as to expand in new markets.</p>
<p>&quot;When you look at the problems both carmakers face in Europe, it seems so odd that so much valuable executive time was devoted to this haggling and fighting over something that was not really worth fighting for,&quot; Schmidt said.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts said the deal will save both carmakers millions of dollars and management time associated with litigation as well as save face for both carmakers who risked damaging their brand images in a nasty court battle.</p>
<p>One attorney involved in the U.S. lawsuit said the cost of bringing the case to trial would have run into hundreds of millions of dollars. &quot;It would have been a great case to try, but the companies are better off this way,&quot; he said.</p>
