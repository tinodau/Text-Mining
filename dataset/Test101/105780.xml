<headline>Court says to rule on VW-GM lawsuit Oct 30.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT, Germany</dateline>
<text>
<p>A German court said Wednesday it would rule at the end of the month on a charge of defamation brought by automaker Volkswagen AG against General Motors and GM's German subsidiary Adam Opel AG.</p>
<p>Following statements from lawyers for both companies at a hearing at the Frankfurt District Court, Judge Guenther Kinnel closed proceedings and said he would announce the court's ruling on Oct. 30.</p>
<p>VW is demanding 10 million German marks ($6.54 million) in damages for statements made by GM and Opel officials last March when GM filed a claim in the United States accusing VW of industrial espionage.</p>
<p>Wednesday's hearing was the latest development in a three-year series of legal battle between the two car giants.</p>
<p>GM alleges VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and seven other former GM managers stole secrets on purchasing and car production plans when they moved to VW in early 1993.</p>
<p>Frustrated by the lack of progress in almost three years of legal action against VW in Germany, GM said at news conferences held on March 8 in Detroit and Ruesselsheim near Frankfurt it would seek justice in the United States in the espionage case by filing a complaint at a federal district court in Michigan.</p>
<p>VW has since filed a motion to have that case dismissed.</p>
<p>At Wednesday's hearing, VW's lawyers said GM had sought to prejudice public opinion at the news conferences when it said its U.S. complaint accused VW and top officials, including VW head Ferdinand Piech, of &quot;conspiracy, conversion, the misappropriation of trade secrets and racketeering.&quot;</p>
<p>The lawyers also accused Opel of seeking to present VW as a criminal organisation in the public eye, for example by distributing a chronology of the three-year saga to the press.</p>
