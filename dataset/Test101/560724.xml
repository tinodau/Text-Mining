<title>EGYPT: Egypt brings new charge against alleged Israel spy.</title>
<headline>Egypt brings new charge against alleged Israel spy.</headline>
<dateline>CAIRO 1997-05-05</dateline>

<p>Egypt's state security prosecutors on Monday brought a new charge carrying the death penalty against an Israeli textile worker on trial for spying against Egypt, security sources said.</p>
<p>They said the new charge was that Azam Azam had made a criminal agreement with an Egyptian and two Israeli women to spy for the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.</p>
<p>His previous charge was that he assisted in economic espionage by giving women's underwear inscribed with invisible ink from Mossad to the Egyptian. It carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison with hard labour.</p>
<p>Azam went on trial in Cairo with alleged Egyptian accomplice Emad Abdelhamid Ismail on April 24. Both men denied they had spied against Egypt. The trail is to resume on May 18.</p>
<p>The other defendants in the case are Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna, who are not in Egypt. Like Azam, they belong to Israel's Druze community.</p>
<p>The sources said Azam's new charge was read to him in his prison cell. It said he had &quot;made a criminal agreement&quot; with the other three defendants to &quot;carry out the crime of spying for Israel and that he presented a sum of money in return for this espionage&quot;.</p>
<p>The charge carries the deast penalty, the sources said.</p>
<p>It was not clear to whom Azam was accused of giving the money.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said at the trial that Greiss gave Ismail $650 when he was recruited and Shawahna offered to pay him $1,000 a month if he helped Mossad.</p>
<p>They said Ismail agreed to help the two women spy for Mossad when he went to Israel in 1996 to train at a women's garment factory.</p>
<p>Azam's lawyer said at the time of the trial that his client faced a maximum penalty of 15 years because he was accused of economic espionage.</p>
<p>He said Azam and Ismail were accused of trying to obtain information about Egyptian factories such as those in the industrial satellite city of 10th of Ramadan City.</p>
<p>Azam's trial has brought Egyptian-Israeli relations to one of their lowest points since the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979.</p>
