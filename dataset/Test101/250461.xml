<headline>VW says GM criminal claims without basis.</headline>
<dateline>WOLFSBURG, Germany 1996-12-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Volkswagen AG on Wednesday said allegations by General Motors Corp of a criminal conspiracy at the German carmaker were without basis and that its attacks have &quot;collapsed like a house of cards&quot;.</p>
<p>VW spokesman Klaus Kocks told Reuters that charges to be filed by German prosecutors against four current or former VW employees proved incontestably that a conspiracy to use GM secrets as alleged by the U.S. carmaker had never existed.</p>
<p>&quot;VW had neither requested nor used any secrets belonging to an outsider,&quot; Kocks told Reuters.  </p>
<p>GM on Wednesday said German prosecutors had told it that criminal charges have been filed against the former GM employees who allegedly stole secret documents when they quit in March 1993 to join VW.</p>
<p>The public prosecutors' office in Darmstadt near Frankfurt also said on Wednesday it would file charges against one of the executives involved in the dispute between the carmakers and will hold a news conference on Friday.</p>
<p>A prosecutors' office spokesman declined further comment.</p>
<p>GM said the charges were filed against former VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, former VW executive Jose Manuel Gutierrez, VW employee Rosario Piazza and Jorge Alvarez, an executive at VW subsidiary SEAT in Spain.</p>
<p>Lopez led a small group of workers who followed him to VW and allegedly brought along thousands of secret documents on parts pricing and plans for a new super-efficient factory, which GM alleges was the model for a new VW plant in Brazil.</p>
<p>A GM source who asked not to be identified scoffed at VW's statements, saying that one of the charges expected to be filed against Lopez was for betrayal of company secrets.</p>
<p>&quot;Betrayal of secrets means that they had to be passed onto someone, and that was VW,&quot; the source said.&quot;These people are being indicted on felonies, punishable by prison sentences if convicted. That speaks for itself.&quot;</p>
<p>The source also said that VW was out to manipulate public opinion by claiming victory since the carmaker did not face criminal charges in Germany nor any of its top executives.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no legal basis for a German prosecutor to file charges against a company as are in this issue,&quot; the source said. &quot;The criminal complaint was always filed against Lopez and others, not against Volkswagen.&quot;</p>
