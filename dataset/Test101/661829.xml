<headline>Egypt spy trial turns into anti-Israel protest.</headline>

<p>An anti-Israel demonstration broke out on Saturday at a heavily guarded Cairo courthouse where an Israeli textile worker is being tried for spying against Egypt in one of the country's most high-profile cases.</p>
<p>&quot;Zionism, Zionism, get out of Egypt. Traitors, traitors,&quot; chanted lawyer Mortada Mohsen, eachoed by more than fifty people.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh you fool, (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu, the blood of our brothers will not be spilled in vain.&quot;</p>
<p>A squad of riot police and special security forces pushed back the crowd and tried to keep order in the courthouse where Israeli Druze Azam Azam and his Egyptian alleged accomplice Emad Abdelhalim Ismail are being tried on charges of making a criminal arrangement to spy for Israel's secret service Mossad.</p>
<p>Two Israeli women are also being tried in absentia in the case, which began on April 24 and dragged Egyptian-Israeli relations to one of their lowest points since the two states signed a peace treaty in 1979.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a shame how this case has been blown out of proportion by the press and the public, but we have full confidence in the Egyptian legal system,&quot; said Asaad Asaad, a member of the minority Druze community who is an adviser to Netanyahu.</p>
<p>&quot;Even relations between Egypt and Israel are better. Egypt replaced the United States as the main mediator in the peace,&quot; he added, referring to Cairo's attempts to restart deadlocked peace talks between Israel and its Palestinian peace partners.</p>
<p>The case was adjourned until next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Lawyers punched and insulted each other at the last session of the trial, prompting the heavy security. The press has devoted many pages to the case, with some colunmists saying the court could not &quot;find it in its heart to acquit the Israeli.&quot;</p>
<p>Farid el-Deeb, lawyer for Azam, who is in his late 20s, has said his client faces a maximum 15 years in prison with hard labour while Ismail could be given a life sentence because he was a civil servant.</p>
<p>Ahmed Bakr, Ismail's lawyer, said both men faced a maximum sentence of life imprisonment but hinted his client might get a lighter sentence or maybe even none at all because of the confessions he made to the prosecutor.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't say whether he's innocent or not; what we can say is that he was deceived. He's a young man who wants to have a good life and others took advantage of that and this is where it led him,&quot; Bakr said beside the prosecution cage while tears coursed down Ismail's cheeks.</p>
<p>&quot;I love this country, in spite of everything, it's my home. If there's one thing that I am certain of, it's that I'm innocent,&quot; said Ismail, 35, who was a state-employed teacher.</p>
<p>According to reports published in the state-run press, Ismail confessed to having sex with one of the Israeli women, and of being blackmailed by photographs of their activities into working for Mossad. He said Azam gave him women's underwear inscribed with invisible ink to carry into Egypt for Mossad.</p>
<p>Defence lawyer Deeb told the court the chemist who examined the underwear was not qualified to handle such an investigation. He then spent most of the two-hour session in debate with the prosecution about the legality of a new, more severe charge brought against Azam earlier this month.</p>
<p>Egyptian state security prosecutors on May 5 accused Azam of agreeing with Ismail and the two women to spy for Mossad. His previous charge was that he assisted in economic espionage by giving the Mossad-inscribed underwear to Ismail.</p>
<p>Prosecutors also state in the charge sheet that Mossad wanted information on Egyptian factories. They said the women offered Ismail money to work for Mossad when he went to Israel in 1996 to train at a women's garment factory.</p>
