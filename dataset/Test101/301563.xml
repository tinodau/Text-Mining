<p>The international community issued a stern warning to Bosnians on Sunday -- build a joint government and carry out economic reforms or there will be no fund-raising conference for the country's reconstruction.</p>
<p>An international donors' conference scheduled for March aimed at raising $1.4 billion for Bosnia is at risk unless peacetime leaders adopt laws on a single central bank, a single currency, a 1997 budget and servicing of the country's external debt, Western envoys said.</p>
<p>&quot;For the donors' conference to be successful, there must be clear proof of you moving forward on your own,&quot; Carl Bildt, the international High Representative to Bosnia, told an economic reform conference in Sarajevo sponsored by his office.</p>
<p>Various foreign experts outlined the necessity of a so-called &quot;immediate action agenda&quot;, by which Bosnia must adopt laws that would provide a long-term framework for creating a self- sustainable economy.</p>
<p>Adopting these laws is a precondition for an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which the donors will be expecting before committing $1.4 billion, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless there is co-operation undertaking the immediate action agenda, unless there is an agreement with the IMF -- the donors' conference will not go forward as scheduled,&quot; said David Lipton, assistant secretary at the U.S. Treasury.</p>
<p>&quot;There must be strong enough prospects that donors' contributions will bring sustained economic recovery, not just temporary relief,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bosnia's newly appointed central government ministers listened carefully to the experts' warnings but even their separate seating plan showed that economic reforms have a way to go before political differences are overcome.</p>
<p>&quot;Political problems are the key. There is non-stop improvisation on who needs to decide what and when we can't agree, it all goes to (three-man) Presidency,&quot; Hasan Muratovic, minister for foreign trade and economy, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Politics is continuing to intervene and stall something that is a technical issue. We need to be able to reach quick decisions without mulling at a higher level,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The slow process of setting up Bosnia's joint institutions after its general elections in September has underlined the need to boost economic relations between the Moslem-Croat federation and the Serb entity, foreign experts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Without a single central bank, single currency, a united payment system and united market, the Bosnian market will devolve into several small segmented markets, none of which will flourish,&quot; Lipton said.</p>
<p>IMF chief of mission in Bosnia, Scott Brown, said he would like to use the rest of January to complete negotiations with the new Bosnian government on adopting laws on a central bank and other key economic issues.</p>
<p>&quot;We would very much hope that difficult but conceptually very simple decisions that are needed to finalise this issue can be taken in a matter of days,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Bildt told the conference the country faced a pivotal moment which could lead to Bosnia becoming a &quot;shining star in this part of Europe&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;But you can also fail, and if you fail, your failure wil be massive.&quot;</p>
