<title>GERMANY: Dollar strength boosts German DAX to new record.</title>
<headline>Dollar strength boosts German DAX to new record.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-12-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>The German DAX index of 30 leading shares ended bourse dealings at a record close on Monday, continuing the rally started last week, with the market boosted by a firmer dollar and strength on Wall Street.</p>
<p>The DAX index hit a new bourse record of 2,860.24 points in early trade, before paring gains slightly to close up 13.08 points, or 0.46 percent, at 2,858.60 points.</p>
<p>Analysts had not been expecting the 2,850 point level to be breached until the end of the year, but the DAX has rallied strongly in the last week, gaining three percent, boosted by dollar strength, benefiting German exporters.</p>
<p>The dollar climbed above the crucial 1.54 mark level on Monday, reaching its highest point for almost six weeks, encouraging the exporting chemical sector in particular.</p>
<p>BASF AG, Bayer AG and Hoechst AG shares all rose strongly.</p>
<p>The DAX surge came despite heavy losses in shares of Europe's largest carmaker, Volkswagen AG, which ended down almost five percent, or 29.50 marks at 587 marks.</p>
<p>Dealers said the rush to sell had been sparked by foreign investors, worried about VW's ongoing legal dispute with U.S. carmaker General Motors Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a catastrophic day for VW shares,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>On Friday, VW accepted the resignation of production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez, at the centre of the legal battle, which the market took as a signal that a settlement could be reached between the two sides.</p>
<p>But GM made no signal of being ready to compromise and the market speculated that the amount of damages VW may ultimately have to pay could be as high as 7.5 billion marks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, shares in Germany's largest bank Deutsche Bank fell 35 pfennigs to end at 72.95 marks after a newspaper reported its asset management unit Morgan Grenfell would have to repatriate 200 million sterling.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank called the 200 million sterling figure &quot;speculation&quot;, but admitted it would have to pay an unspecified level of compensation to investors.</p>
