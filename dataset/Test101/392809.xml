<p>Three major German carmakers said on Thursday they have or soon will resume production after Spanish truck drivers ended a two-week walkout, allowing parts to be delivered to the idled production plants.</p>
<p>The carmakers, who ran into trouble because parts could not be delivered for &quot;just-in-time&quot; production methods where parts arrive only a few hours or days before their use, said additional shifts would be added to make up for lost output.</p>
<p>Mercedes-Benz AG said it began again on Thursday making vehicles and vehicle parts at its two Spanish factories after the two-week strike was ended on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Production of about 1,000 of Mercedes' V-Class transporters was affected by the week-long stoppage in production at a plant in Vitoria and also at a parts production plant in Barcelona.</p>
<p>Adam Opel AG, a unit of General Motors Corp, said it would resume producton at two German plants from Monday.</p>
<p>Volkswagen AG said it would resume some production of its Polo vehicle at its Wolfsburg and Pamplona plants on Friday. It added that output of the Golf model had not been affected by the strike.</p>
<p>Opel said production of the Vectra saloon would resume at its plant in Ruesselsheim on Monday since parts deliveries from Spain would take a few days to reach the Frankfurt area plant.</p>
<p>At Opel's plant in Bochum, the spokesman said production would resume on Monday for the Astra vehicle.</p>
<p>Opel also planned to resume production of the Corsa vehicle at its Eisenach facility on Friday, the official said.</p>
<p>Opel on Tuesday said some 20,000 workers were affected by the suspension of production and that about 11,000 vehicles could not be built during the Spanish strike.</p>
<p>At Volkswagen, the carmaker said it would resume some production of the Polo vehicle on Friday and that it expected parts supplies to stabilise and for normal operations to resume on Monday.</p>
<p>VW began cutting production of the Polo last Tuesday and the carmaker said the shutdown prevented production of about 3,900 vehicles.</p>
<p>German carmakers Audi AG, a unit of Volkswagen, and BMW AG said they did not suffer any impact from the Spanish strike.</p>
