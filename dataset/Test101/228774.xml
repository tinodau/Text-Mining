<headline>VW boss Piech takes over some duties of Lopez.</headline>

<p>Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech Monday took over some of the responsibilities of the VW executive who resigned amid an industrial espionage dispute with General Motors Corp.</p>
<p>An internal memo by Piech to top VW executives dated Monday said Piech has taken over group-wide control of &quot;product optimization and procurement&quot; following the resignation last Friday of VW production guru Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.</p>
<p>Lopez, dubbed the &quot;cost killer&quot; and credited with helping the turnaround at VW after it posted a billion-mark loss ($650 million) in 1993, is the target of a German criminal probe into allegations he stole secret documents when he left GM that year.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Spanish-born 55-year-old Lopez, who is also named in a U.S. racketeering lawsuit filed by GM and its German subsidiary Adam Opel AG, resigned to prepare his defence against the U.S. charges and other legal issues.</p>
<p>GM and Opel executives have declined to predict how much they would seek in a trial but observers have speculated at between $4 billion and $5 billion -- an amount which could be tripled under a U.S. racketeering law first used to fight organised crime.</p>
<p>The management reshuffling at VW included the naming of Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, who followed Lopez to VW from GM, to the VW management board from his current position as a senior executive at VW's Spanish subisidary SEAT.</p>
<p>Garcia Sanz will oversee VW purchasing activities, according to the memo obtained by Reuters. VW executive Peter Hartz was also named to take over Lopez's duties with VW's America and Africa units.</p>
<p>Piech made the management changes as VW stock fell nearly 6 percent on Monday after GM said it would not let up on its legal battle against the Wolfsburg-based carmaker, Europe's biggest.</p>
<p>Volkswagen shares fell 34.50 marks to 582 marks ($375) but pared some of the losses to end bourse trade down 29.50 marks at 587 marks ($378).</p>
<p>Speculation about a possible out-of-court deal over the U.S. lawsuit rose after Lopez quit his post on Friday -- one of the conditions GM laid down for any settlement.</p>
<p>Opel Chief Executive David Herman told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published Monday that a deal was &quot;desirable&quot; but reaffirmed that GM and Opel still wanted a public apology from VW as well as hefty monetary damages.</p>
<p>VW officials have said they would not meet the conditions and have denied the allegations made by the U.S. auto giant.</p>
<p>GM officials also said statements from VW that Lopez would stay with VW as a consultant were insulting, saying they wanted Lopez never to work again for VW.</p>
<p>GM officials also said they were astounded at VW saying it would meet the obligations of Lopez's contract, which runs through March 1998. A VW official said Lopez would get about 4 million marks ($2.6 million) for his contract that runs through March 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;This is absolutely not sufficient,&quot; said one GM executive who asked not to be identified. &quot;Letting him resign and then having top executives praise him and say that they can see him as a top consultant in the future does not meet our requirements.&quot;</p>
<p>Lopez was credited with slashing, by some reports, up to 17 billion marks ($11 billion) in costs by cutting the prices it pays to component suppliers, which can make up half the cost of a car, and by opting to buy more parts from eastern Europe.</p>
<p>VW started courting Lopez in 1992 after Piech, the grandson of luxury sportscar manufacturer Ferdinand Porsch, took over control at the carmaker with plans to restore VW's fortunes.</p>
<p>GM claims that Lopez started leaking information about Opel's plans as early as December 1992 and that he asked for a briefing on future plans just hours before he quit GM in March 1993 and took along a number of executives with him.</p>
<p>A meeting among lawyers in the U.S. lawsuit, which also names Piech as a defendant, with the Judge Nancy Edmunds is scheduled for Tuesday in Detroit.</p>
<p>The meeting, called a &quot;status conference,&quot; will decide on how both sides will proceed with the sworn testimony of defendants and witnesses. Discussion of a settlement at the meeting was not expected to take place, industry sources said.</p>
