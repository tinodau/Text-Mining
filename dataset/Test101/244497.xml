<headline>VW head to express regret to GM - paper.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-12-09</dateline>

<p>Volkswagen AG management board chairman Ferdinand Piech will express his &quot;deepest regrets&quot; to General Motors Corp about allegations that a former VW executive stole industrial secrets, a newspaper said on Monday.</p>
<p>Germany's Die Welt said in a statement ahead of publication on Tuesday that VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said that Piech would make the statement on Thursday.</p>
<p>A VW spokesman was not immediately available for comment on the newspaper report.  </p>
<p>VW head to express regret to GM - paper</p>
<p>The statement by Die Welt did not say what Piech would exactly say to GM and its German subsidary, Adam Opel AG, nor how the statement would be issued to the U.S. carmaker.</p>
<p>GM and Opel have alleged that former VW purchasing executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua stole thousands of secret documents when and some associates abruptly quit GM in March 1993 to join VW, which is Europe's largest carmaker.</p>
<p>GM had set down as a condition that VW publicly apologise before any progress could be made in seeking an out-of-court settlement to a U.S. civil court lawsuit filed by GM against VW that charges the Wolfsburg-based carmaker with racketeering.</p>
<p>The other conditions included that VW sever all contact with Lopez and other former GM executives now at VW who are named in the U.S. lawsuit as well as payment for damages.</p>
<p>The newspaper also said German prosecutors will detail on Friday criminal charges filed against Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard who resigned from VW in November. A spokeswoman for the Frankfurt prosecutors' office has said a decision on any charges against Lopez would be made by the end of December.</p>
