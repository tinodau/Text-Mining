<p>Carmaker Adam Opel AG, a unit of General Motors Corp, said on Friday it has extended the contract of Opel managing director David Herman for five Herman, 51, was named to head Opel in July 1992 and has spent most of the last five years battling rival Volkswagen AG over allegations of corporate spying by former GM executive Jose Ignacio Lopez when he defected to VW in 1993.</p>
<p>Opel said the supervisory board cited the efforts of Herman, who is also a GM vice president, to improve the competitiveness of Opel's plants in Germany as one reason for extending his contract.</p>
<p>The move was considered unusual because, since the the early 1980s, Opel generally changed managing directors on a three-year rotation.</p>
<p>Industry officials had also speculated Herman would be replaced as part of a shake-up at GM. One potential replacement was Mark Hogan, 45, who was recently named general manager of operations for GM's North American Operations Small Car Group.</p>
<p>In January, shortly after announcing a deal to end the dispute with VW, Herman himself prompted speculation about his possibly leaving Opel when he said he had devoted most of his time to the VW fight and wanted to return to making cars.</p>
<p>Opel and VW reached a deal in Germany under which VW would pay the carmaker $1 billion and agree to buy billions of marks worth of parts over the next seven years from GM units. Opel agreed in return to drop racketeering lawsuits in the U.S.</p>
<p>Opel officials said the renewal of Herman's contract indicated approval from top GM executives for the man and his plans to expand the carmaker's operations into eastern Europe and Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;This is confirmation that he was been doing the right things over the last five years,&quot; said one Opel official.</p>
<p>Opel will hold its annual news conference next Thursday in Frankfurt. The carmaker said in February it expected a profit for 1996 of between 300 and 350 million marks compared with 363 million marks ($210 million) in 1995.</p>
