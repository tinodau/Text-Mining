<title>UK: Closing stock market indices.</title>
<headline>Closing stock market indices.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON</dateline>
<text>
<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended Friday.</p>
<p>LONDON - British shares ended mixed as investors took profits in blue chips after this week's record-setting rally and funnelled those profits into mid-caps, which have lagged far behind the key FTSE 100 so far this year. The FTSE 100 closed at 5,031.3, down 55.5 points but up 132 points on the week.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - German shares ended a lackluster bourse session lower as overnight weakness on Wall Street and a touch of pre-weekend catharsis hit sentiment on the stock exchange. The DAX-30 index closed at 4,354.15, down 60.20 points and down 54.64 from last Friday. In later screen-based trade the IBIS DAX index ended at 4,342.31, down 85.77 points.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares fell nearly 2 percent as a retreat in the dollar and U.S. stocks prompted heavy profit-taking on the bourse. The CAC-40 index closed down 60.07 points at 2,996.27, a fall of 53.17 on the week.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares ended 1 percent lower as profit-taking, a weaker dollar and losses in early Wall Street trade took their toll, dealers said. The Swiss market index closed at 5,864.8, down 57.3 points and down 33.4 from last week.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks reversed early losses to close modestly higher, supported by a technical rebound and a recovery in construction shares, brokers said. The 225-share Nikkei average closed at 19,604.46, up 128.61 points but down 199.92 from last Friday's close.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell a sharp 157 points, or 0.94 percent to 16,516, just after the start of trading morning, a much-needed correction after the market's record-breaking run, brokers said. The Hang Seng index closed at 16,647.54, down 25.73 points but up 268.32 on the week.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - The Australian share market turned weaker again in the last half-hour as bellwether BHP took a new blow when it announced yet another resignation from senior ranks. The all ordinaries index closed at 2,711.4, down 6.3 points and down 16.1 from a week ago.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African industrial shares ended weak after taking a fright from Wall Street which fell more than 100 points shortly after the opening, dealers said. The all-share index closed at 7,599.2, down 15.2 points but gaining 142.4 on the week. The all gold index closed at 996.4, up 29.3 points and gaining 32.7 on the week, while the industrial index closed at 9,283.4, down 30.8 points but up 137.9 from last Friday.</p>
