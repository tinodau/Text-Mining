<p>A German court said on Wednesday it would rule at the end of the month on a charge of defamation brought by carmaker Volkswagen AG against General Motors and GM's German subsidiary Adam Opel AG.</p>
<p>Following statements from lawyers for both companies at a hearing at the Frankfurt District Court, Judge Guenther Kinnel closed proceedings and said he would announce the court's ruling on October 30.</p>
<p>VW is demanding 10 million marks ($6.54 million) in damages for statements made by GM and Opel officials last March when GM filed a claim in the United States accusing VW of industrial espionage.</p>
<p>Wednesday's hearing was the latest development in a three-year series of legal battle between the two car giants.</p>
<p>GM alleges VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and seven other former GM managers stole secrets on purchasing and car production plans when they moved to VW in early 1993.</p>
<p>Frustrated by the lack of progress in almost three years of legal action against VW in Germany, GM said at news conferences held on March 8 in Detroit and Ruesselsheim near Frankfurt it would seek justice in the United States in the espionage case by filing a complaint at a federal district court in Michigan.</p>
<p>VW has since filed a motion to have that case dismissed.</p>
<p>At Wednesday's hearing, VW's lawyers said GM had sought to prejudice public opinion at the news conferences when it said its U.S. complaint accused VW and top officials, including VW head Ferdinand Piech, of &quot;conspiracy, conversion, the misappropriation of trade secrets and racketeering.&quot;</p>
<p>The lawyers also accused Opel of seeking to present VW as a criminal organisation in the public eye, for example by distributing a chronology of the three-year saga to the press.</p>
<p>&quot;You are welcome to try to prove that in the U.S., and we will know more when that lawsuit is over, but you were not justified to prejudice the case here on March 8,&quot; VW lawyer Juergen Kicker told Opel's representatives.</p>
<p>Opel's lawyer Peter Heckel countered: &quot;The behaviour of your client reminds me of a wrongdoer who cries 'Stop Thief' to conceal his own guilt.&quot;</p>
<p>GM and Opel had a right to inform the public of the contents of its legal complaint and had tried hard to find adequate German translations for U.S. legal terms like &quot;racketeering&quot;, Heckel said.</p>
<p>VW and Opel dispatched their legal experts to the hearings but there were no senior executives present. ($1=1.5297 Mark)</p>
