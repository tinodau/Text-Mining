<p>Volkswagen AG, helped by strong performances in Brazil and Asia, said on Thursday sales in January surged 18.1 percent to 329,300 vehicles but it failed to attract a wave of new car buyers at home in Germany.</p>
<p>The Wolfsburg-based carmaker said January sales in Germany rose two percent to 73,300 vehicles from 71,870 in January 1996, coming at the expense of hefty foreign growth that underpinned VW's 1996 profit doubling to 673 million marks ($399 million).</p>
<p>Volkswagen said all of its brands contributed to the higher sales, which it said were driven by new vehicles that were launched in late 1996 and finally reaching major markets.</p>
<p>VW said passenger car sales under the VW brand rose 15 percent to 212,500, while its Audi luxury brand rose 32 percent to 43,800. VW said sales at its Czech Skoda unit rose 7.5 percent to 18,100 and they rose 18 percent to 28,500 at Spanish-based SEAT.</p>
<p>VW late last year launched a number of new vehicles, including a remodeled VW Passat saloon and the new Audi A3, a three-door model that has become the new entry point at VW's luxury car division.</p>
<p>&quot;The sales increase in January is clearly the result of our product offensive and the roll-out of new vehicles,&quot; a VW spokesman said.</p>
<p>VW, which has sought to shrug off a fresh scandal involving allegations that VW workers demanded and received bribes from contractors, said it expected to maintain its international market position despite &quot;rather subdued&quot; industry conditions.</p>
<p>But the carmaker has shown no sign of braking its desire to grab a bigger part of the west European vehicle market, where VW's sales excluding Germany last month rose 12.6 percent to 119,000 vehicles despite ongoing weak economic conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;VW is obviously continuing its rush for market share in 1997 and the January data confirms that,&quot; said Peter Schmidt, analyst at Automotive Industry Data in Tamworth, England.</p>
<p>&quot;The motivation is VW's belief that the European car market will soon be saturated and one can only increase sales by taking from rivals,&quot; he said. &quot;They are taking advantage of their lower costs to cut prices and steal buyers from others.&quot;</p>
<p>VW's sales in Brazil, a key market where the carmaker has production facilities, surged 45 percent to 57,400 vehicles, while sales in Japan rose 36 percent to 4,000 vehicles following a heavy bout of advertising and marketing.</p>
<p>In North America, VW's sales rose 21 percent to 16,000 vehicles, while sales in China rose 60 percent to 22,600 vehicles where the carmaker is the No. 1 selling brand.</p>
<p>Industry analysts said VW has been able to finance its international expansion by the impact of controversial production guru Jose Ignacio Lopez's cost-cutting measures at the carmaker having a greater impact on operations.</p>
<p>Lopez, who resigned from VW last November in disgrace over allegations of industrial spying when he quit rival General Motors Corp in 1993 to join VW, sharply reduced the number of car platforms to a handful to streamline output.</p>
