<title>GERMANY: VW shares tumble after U.S. court ruling.</title>
<headline>VW shares tumble after U.S. court ruling.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-11-27</dateline>

<p>Shares in German carmaker Volkswagen AG tumbled about five percent in active pre-bourse IBIS dealings on Wednesday after a U.S. judge denied VW's motion to dismiss racketeering claims by rival Opel.</p>
<p>VW shares fell as much as 33.30 marks ($21.83) to 607.20 marks before trading at 0830 GMT down 29 marks at 611.50 marks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the rest of the market was slightly weaker, the DAX index of leading shares, which includes VW, down 0.28 percent at 2,800.74 points.</p>
<p>The U.S. ruling could open VW to potentially higher damages in a jury trial verdict since the U.S. racketeering law approved by the judge calls for damages to be tripled.</p>
<p>In addition, VW shares were under pressure after VW said it would decide on Monday whether to introduce short-time working hours at its main plant in Wolfsburg because the supply of car parts has been affected by a French trucker strike.</p>
<p>But traders said the threat of hefty damages in the U.S. lawsuit filed by Opel and parent company General Motors Corp was the primary reason for the stock's drop.</p>
<p>In New York, GM shares closed up $1/8 at $58-3/8 in an overall weaker market.</p>
<p>The U.S. lawsuit centres on Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a former GM production executive who abruptly quit to join VW in 1993 and is under investigation in the U.S. and Germany for allegedly taking along secret documents.</p>
<p>Other top VW executives, including VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech, are named as defendants in the suit.</p>
<p>GM claims the stolen documents, which included information on future product plans, parts prices and manufacturing techniques, unfairly allowed VW to reduce its costs, causing GM unspecified financial damage.</p>
<p>Under the racketeering law, known as RICO, GM has claimed that Volkswagen, Lopez and other top executives participated in a conspiracy to steal documents and transport them to Germany.</p>
<p>In addition to the civil lawsuit, Lopez's lawyer said he expected German prosecutors to file criminal charges against his client by the end of November.</p>
<p>A U.S. grand jury is also investigating Lopez and a Frankfurt appellate court last Friday approved sending documents from the German probe to U.S. prosecutors.</p>
