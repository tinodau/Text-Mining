<title>GERMANY: German shareholder lobbyists slam VW/GM agreement.</title>
<headline>German shareholder lobbyists slam VW/GM agreement.</headline>

<p>Lobbyists for German shareholders' rights this weekend criticised the out-of-court deal reached by car giants Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp over allegations of industrial espionage.</p>
<p>While lobbyists welcomed the end to the companies' lengthy feud, they said the deal had made it impossible for minority shareholders to identify who was to blame, and could end up costing shareholders a considerable amount.</p>
<p>&quot;The question arises -- who is actually supposed to pay this $100 million?,&quot; Reinhild Kreitel, spokeswoman for the German small shareholders' asociation, told Reuters.</p>
<p>VW averted a potentially costly U.S. jury ruling on Thursday when it settled with GM over charges that cost-cutting production guru Jose Ignacio Lopez stole GM data when he joined VW in 1993.</p>
<p>VW agreed to pay GM $100 million in compensation, buy $1 billion worth of GM parts over the next seven years and retract statements such as charges that GM may have tampered with evidence before it was released to German prosecutors.</p>
<p>In return, GM agreed to drop its U.S. lawsuit in a Detroit federal court based on racketeering laws that call for any damages awarded by a jury to be automatically tripled.</p>
<p>While VW said the deal would not have a serious impact on its profits, Keitel said the shareholder lobby group was considering withholding approval for the VW management and supervisory boards at the next shareholder meeting.</p>
<p>The rise of some 12 percent in VW's share price this week -- the stock closed Friday up three percent at 712 marks -- would not be enough to compensate shareholders for potential losses arising from the incident, Keitel said.</p>
<p>&quot;The shares had been burdened by the court case for a long time. Now they are merely making up those losses,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Ekkehard Wenger, founder of the German association for promotion of shareholder democracy, also said it would be unacceptable to expect small shareholders to pay for management errors.</p>
<p>&quot;The management board will have to come up with some explanations at the annual general meeting,&quot; he said in a telephone interview.</p>
