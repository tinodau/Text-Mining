<headline>Prosecutor charges Lopez but sees no VW collusion.</headline>

<p>German prosecutors said Friday that criminal charges have been filed against four former General Motors Corp. executives alleging that they stole corporate secrets when they left GM to join Volkswagen.</p>
<p>But the prosecutors said they found no evidence VW executives colluded in the transfer of secrets -- contrary to allegations made by GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG -- even though the data was used by one defendant in presentations to VW executives.</p>
<p>Charges were filed against former VW production executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and three other former GM employees, Jose Manuel Gutierrez, Rosario Piazza and Jorge Alavarez, who followed Lopez to VW in March 1993.</p>
<p>If convicted, the defendants could face up to five years in prison or a fine. But legal experts say first-time offenders do not usually face prison.</p>
<p>The charges must now be approved by a German court and prosecutors declined to predict when a trial could begin. In the meantime, Lopez, who is believed to be living in Spain, and the others would remain free.</p>
<p>Gerhard Andres, the chief prosecutor at the Darmstadt public prosecutors' office, said the four were officially charged Dec. 6 under allegations of embezzlement and betrayal of corporate secrets.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the charges did not assess the amount of damage that GM suffered through the loss of its documents because that task was not part of their probe.</p>
<p>Andres also clearly stated that prosecutors in the course of their investigation had found no evidence that VW staff had colluded with Lopez in the theft of documents.</p>
<p>&quot;I say with all clarity that we always kept an eye on this suspicion,&quot; Andres told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;But the investigation found no sufficient indications that someone from VW in any way colluded in the alleged deeds as we have presented them here relating to Lopez and the others.&quot;</p>
<p>Volkswagen said Friday the charges against Lopez cleared the way for fresh talks to settle GM's U.S. lawsuit against the German carmaker since it was not implicated in the German criminal investigation.</p>
<p>But a GM official dismissed VW's comments, saying there were no talks planned and that the U.S. lawsuit had nothing to do with the German criminal probe.</p>
<p>&quot;As we said all along, the criminal charges in Germany have nothing to do with the U.S. civil court lawsuit,&quot; a GM source said. &quot;There are no settlement discussions at present. Nor are any planned.&quot;</p>
<p>The German criminal charges add to the troubles for Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard who also faces a U.S. criminal probe by prosecutors in Detroit in addition to GM's lawsuit, which is partially based on the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisation law first used to fight the mafia.</p>
<p>GM is expected to demand in a jury trial damages in the billions of dollars from VW since it claims Lopez used its documents to cut costs by more than a billion marks ($647.7 million) and that its cost advantages over VW were reduced.</p>
<p>Any U.S. lawsuit award by a jury could be tripled under the U.S. racketeering law.</p>
<p>Previous attempts to settle the U.S. lawsuit have failed because VW has rejected GM's conditions, which are that it sever ties with Lopez, admit to wrongdoing and pay damages.</p>
<p>Andres said the 60-page indictment alleges Lopez began forming plans to obtain secret GM and Opel documents after meeting with VW management board Chairman Ferdinand Piech on Nov. 29, 1993, to discuss joining the Wolfsburg-based carmaker.</p>
<p>Lopez then approached Gutierrez, Piazza and Alvarez about following him to Volkswagen and they allegedly began collecting secret GM data on research, planning and purchasing for new factories as well as top-selling GM cars under development, according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>Gutierrez resigned his position as a top VW production executive in November, but Piazza and Alvarez are still working for VW or for consulting groups tied to VW.</p>
<p>&quot;The aim of obtaining these documents was to use them in the interest of VW after the transfer there,&quot; Andres said. &quot;The accused did not hand the documents back to Opel or General Motors when they left, but kept them for themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Andres said the tens of thousands of documents included plans for a factory called &quot;Plant X&quot; in Spain, pricing data for European production and cost data on GM vehicles as well as documents for a new car being developed by GM called the &quot;O-Car.&quot;</p>
