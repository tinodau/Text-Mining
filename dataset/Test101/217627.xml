<p>German carmaker Adam Opel AG said on Tuesday that it felt vindicated by a U.S. federal court's decision to allow its parent General Motors to sue carmaker Volkswagen AG under racketeering law.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision proves that Opel and GM can establish an appropriate legal basis for its claims against the defendants,&quot; Opel said in a statement on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>A federal judge in Detroit earlier denied Volkswagen's motion to dismiss racketeering claims by GM.</p>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Nancy Edmunds said in a written order that GM's complaint against VW adequately meets the the standard needed to proceed under the RICO law, or the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act.</p>
<p>If a U.S. jury finds VW financially damaged GM through the theft of trade secrets, VW could be forced to pay triple damages if found guilty -- and could lead to a payout in the billions of dollars, sources said.</p>
<p>Opel's demands for any settlement, made in August 1993, are a public apology, the resignation of VW executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and a substantial payout for damages to the carmaker.</p>
<p>Lopez, a Spaniard, and three other former GM executives now at VW, are under investigation in Germany and the U.S. for stealing secret data when they left Opel for GM in March 1993.</p>
<p>Media reports in recent days have said VW has held secret talks with GM aimed at settling the civil lawsuit that GM filed last March alleging some VW officials took the secret documents when they left the company.</p>
<p>Both German-based Volkswagen and Opel have declined comment on the reports.</p>
<p>But industry sources in Germany said the threat of a judgement against VW in the U.S. civil lawsuit is rising and has prompted more talks between the two companies.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation for VW is so threatening that they are trying to demonstrate to their shareholders that they are seeking to limit the damages,&quot; said one source who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>Contact between the two carmakers -- including a reported meeting in Detroit between VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen and GM executive committeee chairman John Smale -- may lead to a deal in the coming weeks to months, the sources said.</p>
<p>Another factor favouring VW seeking a deal was Lopez's lawyer saying in early November that he expected German prosecutors to soon file criminal charges against his client.</p>
<p>In addition, a U.S. grand jury investigation in Detroit into VW and its top executives will also now have the chance to review documents from the German criminal investigation after a Frankfurt court approved last Friday the transfer of documents.</p>
<p>Under U.S. law, criminal indictments can be filed against both a corporation and also the responsible individual members of that company's management.</p>
<p>Lopez and the others joined Volkswagen after it reported a massive one billion mark loss and then implemented innovative production practices that have since led to hefty profits.</p>
<p>GM has alleged that secret production plans for its &quot;Plant X&quot; were used by VW to build a new plant in Brazil. Other documents related to purchasing contracts were also allegedly stolen by Lopez and three other former GM employees now at VW. VW has vehemently denied the charges.</p>
