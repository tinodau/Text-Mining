<p>General Motors Corp and Volkswagen AG have been holding secret talks to solve their dispute over the U.S. carmaker's claims of industrial spying by its German rival, a legal source told Reuters on Thursday.</p>
<p>The source, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters there has been &quot;real progress in settlement discussions&quot; in the case over allegations that a former GM executive and his associates stole documents when they left to join VW in 1993.</p>
<p>Industry sources said a settlement deal could be announced as soon as Friday.</p>
<p>The talks began in early January, the source said.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems as though VW is prepared to publically retract statements that they made some years ago about GM and Opel about having manipulated or falsified evidence,&quot; the source said, noting GM has moderated its stance in the dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;The other thing which is of equal significance is that they will retract, at least that is their offer, any suggestions that GM or Opel may have run an attack against Germany as an industrial location,&quot; the source said of VW.</p>
<p>&quot;This has prepared the basis to go further,&quot; the source said. &quot;You can assume the talks are going on and are intensive.&quot;</p>
<p>Hans Wilhelm Gaeb, a vice president at GM's European headquarters Zurich, declined official comment on any talks between the two carmakers. A VW spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>But Gaeb said GM was committed to being a &quot;fair player&quot; with VW and reiterated that its dispute targeted a handful of current or former VW officials, not the company itself.</p>
<p>&quot;We have made clear that we are fair players and not a company that is going to push another competitor to the wall. I think all possiblities are still open,&quot; Gaeb told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always made clear that we have respect for VW. We have not wanted to damage VW as a firm. We had to take the legal action in Detroit to get this issue moved,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a way to show this was a serious situation.&quot;</p>
<p>The source also said GM was still committed to receiving damages, calling it &quot;a matter of principle&quot;.</p>
<p>But the source added, &quot;The amount to be claimed is subject to the atmosphere of the discussions and that the other conditions be met.&quot;</p>
<p>GM and Opel have been at legal odds since Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and a group of former executives left GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG, in March 1993 to join VW.</p>
<p>GM charged that Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, took along thousands of secret GM documents that helped VW return to profitability and blunted GM's competitive edge.</p>
<p>The Detroit carmaker set down three guidelines for any settlement talks -- Lopez and those who followed him to GM must leave VW, the German carmaker had to issue a public apology and must also agree to pay for damages.</p>
<p>Lopez quit VW in late November, which was shortly before German prosecutors filed criminal charges against him and three of his associates.</p>
<p>Previous attempts to settle the lawsuit GM brought against VW in a Detroit federal court charging the carmaker with racketeering have failed, in part because VW refused to retract statements made by top company officials.</p>
