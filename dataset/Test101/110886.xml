<headline>Clinton signs annual intelligence bill.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-10-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>President Bill Clinton on Friday signed into law a spending authorisation for a dozen U.S. intelligence agencies despite misgivings about some of its provisions, which he said he would seek to rectify.</p>
<p>Clinton also signed a related measure, the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, which strengthens safeguards against the theft or misuse of proprietary business information.</p>
<p>&quot;Until today, federal law has not accorded appropriate or adequate protection to trade secrets, making it difficult to prosecute thefts involving this kind of information,&quot; Clinton said in a written statement.</p>
<p>He said the new statute was &quot;an outstanding example&quot; of his administration, Congress and business working together to provide law enforcement with the tools to combat the problems of economic espionage and trade secret theft.</p>
<p>The funding level of the intelligence authorisation was secret, but Clinton said in a statement it &quot;largely reflects my budget request.&quot;</p>
<p>The United States reportedly spends about $28 billion a year on foreign intelligence operations.</p>
<p>Clinton expressed reservations about some provisions of the bill that he said either duplicate initiatives he has taken or encroach on his constitutional powers.</p>
<p>These included a stipulation that two new National Security Council committees be created, a requirement that the director of central intelligence (DCI) be consulted on certain appointments, and the mandating of three new intelligence posts.</p>
<p>&quot;The administration has supported the concept of obtaining the DCI's concurrence or consultation prior to the appointment of certain other intelligence officials,&quot; Clinton said. But he said he would mandate this by executive order to avoid possible constitutional problems with making it law.</p>
<p>Clinton said the three new intelligence posts would just be another layer of bureaucracy, and vowed to ask the next Congress to repeal this provision.</p>
