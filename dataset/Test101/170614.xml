<p>Germany's Volkswagen AG warned rival carmakers on Wednesday not to use a new company history revealing its former Nazi links and Third Reich slave labourers as negative advertising against it.</p>
<p>Speaking at the presentation of the book, spokesman Klaus Kocks said VW, which is now embroiled in a bitter court fight with U.S. carmaker General Motors, felt a moral responsibility to shed light on this dark chapter in its history.</p>
<p>If rivals made a link between the company's past and present, though, it would amount to a cheap bid to boost sales at VW's expense, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't sell cars with things like this,&quot; Kocks said.</p>
<p>VW is fighting an uphill battle in German and American courts with charges of defamation against General Motors over the U.S. company's charge that top GM managers took secret documents with them when they joined VW in 1993.</p>
<p>VW says GM tried to slander its name by portraying the Wolfsburg-based carmaker as a criminal organisation and accusing top officials, including VW chief Ferdinand Piech, of conspiracy, misappropriation of trade secrets and racketeering.</p>
<p>The two carmakers have been bitterly squaring off ever since Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua left GM to join VW as head of production and procurement in 1993.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever one thinks of Mr Lopez, either positive or negative, that has nothing to do with slave labourers in the Third Reich,&quot; Kocks said at the presentation of the 1,055-page history &quot;Volkswagen and its Workers in the Third Reich.&quot;</p>
<p>Hans Mommsen, a leading German historian and co-author of the VW-funded study, thanked the company for funding his study with 3.3 million marks ($2.17 million) and fully respecting its pledge not to try to influence or censor his conclusions.</p>
<p>He also thanked current VW head Ferdinand Piech, the grandson of VW founder Ferdinand Porsche, and said there had been &quot;quite a misunderstanding&quot; over a reported row between him and Piech over his portrayal of the firm's founding family.</p>
<p>Der Spiegel magazine reported on Monday that Piech had accused Mommsen of turning his original manuscript into an attack on his grandfather and his father, VW's wartime chief executive Anton Piech.</p>
<p>Kocks said Piech was personally concerned about the portrayal, which called Porsche &quot;morally indifferent&quot; Nazi and said he and his son-in-law Anton Piech were mainly responsible for the treatment of thousands of slave labourers at VW.</p>
<p>But he insisted the current VW boss was still committed to VW's decision to come clean on its past, something it backed by funding the book, a university chair and a VW archive.</p>
<p>The book recounts how Porsche, who had been technical director at Daimler-Benz AG, took up Adolf Hitler's call to produce a cheap popular car -- the Volkswagen Beetle -- and founded VW near Hanover to manufacture it.</p>
<p>The plant employed about 16,000 workers, most of them slave labourers from conquered countries, prisoners of war or concentration camp inmates. Many died at the Wolfsburg</p>
<p>Fascinated by his technical dream, Porsche had no scruples about keeping slave labourers in dismal living conditions and forcing them to build cars and armaments, including the V1 rockets fired at London and other cities during the war.</p>
<p>The book's publisher, Econ Verlag, said the original print run was only 3,000 but it expected demand for many more copies because of a recent surge of interest in the Third Reich.</p>
<p>&quot;Hitler's Willing Executioners,&quot; a disputed Holocaust book by U.S. sociologist Daniel Goldhagen, now ranks high in German best-seller lists despite its portrayal of the Germans as ingrained and blood-thirsty anti-Semites.</p>
<p>The daily Die Welt remarked it would be ironical if the controversy surrounding Goldhagen's study helped sell the VW book. Mommsen has been one of Goldhagen's toughest critics.</p>
