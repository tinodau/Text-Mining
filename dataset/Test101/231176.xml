<p>A Volkswagen AG attorney predicted Tuesday it will be at least two years before the German automaker goes to trial in the United States to defend itself against corporate spying charges from General Motors Corp.</p>
<p>James Denvir, a Washington-based attorney representing VW in the GM civil suit, said VW remained open to settling the matter but there were no talks currently.</p>
<p>&quot;They are interested in a settlement that would be fair to both sides,&quot; Denvir told reporters following a scheduling conference in federal court before U.S. Distric Judge Nancy Edmunds.</p>
<p>GM filed suit in March, alleging its former purchasing chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and several other executives stole confidential parts pricing, product plans and manufacturing documents when they defected to VW in 1993.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a lawyer representing Lopez and three other defendants told Edmunds he planned to file a motion asking that they be temporarily removed from GM's suit so they can concentrate on their defence against likely criminal charges. A hearing on that motion was set for Jan. 29, 1997.</p>
<p>Attorney Plato Cacheris said charges against Lopez will likely be filed by German prosecutors before the end of 1996. Lopez resigned his post at VW last week.</p>
<p>The other defendants to be included in the motion are Jose Manual Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez and Rosario Piazza. All three men quit GM on March 22, 1993, 12 days after Lopez left. Alvarez and Piazza joined VW's operations in Spain, while Gutierrez went to work for VW in Germany.</p>
<p>GM attorney Michael Millikin said after the scheduling conference that he expected Edmunds to deny the motion because it was common for U.S. civil claims to proceed at the same time as criminal cases.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not even contemplating not having all the defendants in this courtroom,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Edmunds and lawyers for both sides spent about two hours Tuesday morning hammering out a schedule for the initial phase of fact-finding and depositions by both sides, a process called discovery.</p>
<p>Noting media reports the two sides are closing in on an out-of-court settlement, Edmunds told reporters and spectators in the courtroom she wanted to &quot;dispel those notions&quot; that a settlement was near.</p>
<p>&quot;This conference is not for the purpose of discussing a settlement,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Edmunds told attorneys to complete their first exchange of documents by the end of February, 1997.</p>
<p>The documents will include a multi-volumed audit of VW from KPMG Peat Marwick's German branch, and thousands of documents the auditing firm took from VW.</p>
<p>Denvir said the number of documents taken by KPMG was so large that VW itself did not know the full extent. VW has said the audit backs up its claims that no confidential GM documents ever got to VW.</p>
<p>The first depositions in the case were scheduled to begin March 10 and proceed through May 30. Edmunds set March 6 as the date of the next discovery status conference.</p>
<p>Responding to a complaint from VW lawyers that GM's discovery demands were too vague, Edmunds said GM must specify which trade secrets it alleges were stolen. While acknowledging the huge scope of the case, she said, &quot;We're going to move this case along.&quot;</p>
<p>In Germany meanwhile, the top executive at GM's Adam Opel AG unit demanded Tuesday that VW cut ties with executives linked to its allegations of industrial spying before any settlement can be reached.</p>
<p>Opel Chief Executive David Herman told Reuters in an interview that &quot;an opportunity to move forward&quot; was lost when VW accepted the resignation of Lopez but said he might stay on as a consultant.</p>
<p>Herman said no settlement talks are currently being held with VW and that none were currently scheduled. Opel has set conditions for a settlement with VW in its U.S. civil court lawsuit -- Lopez and other collaborators must leave VW, a public acknowledgment of error must be issued and VW must pay unspecified damages.</p>
