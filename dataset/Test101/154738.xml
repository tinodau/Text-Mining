<title>GERMANY: German shares off day's highs after UK rate hike.</title>
<headline>German shares off day's highs after UK rate hike.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-10-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>German shares ended Wednesday's bourse trade slightly higher, but at the day's low point, after the dollar slipped and German bonds lost some sheen following the surprise raising of the UK interest rate.</p>
<p>The DAX index of 30 blue-chip shares closed up 5.11 points, or 0.19 percent, at 2,678.73, slipping back about ten points after Britain raised its base interest rate by 25 basis points to six percent.</p>
<p>German players took the move as a signal that German interest rates would not sink further in the future.</p>
<p>German exporting stocks also suffered after the dollar lost ground against the mark, slipping under 1.51 marks.</p>
<p>Earlier the DAX had touched 2,691.55, encouraged by a firm close on Wall Street overnight, but volumes had been thin, dealers said.</p>
<p>One of the most heavily traded DAX stocks was German's largest commercial bank, Deutsche Bank, which rose 94 pfennigs to touch 71.30 marks, after it said management board member Rolf Breuer would suceed Hilmar Kopper as chief executive.</p>
<p>The stock lost some of its gains to end bourse trade up 49 pfennigs, or 0.7 percent, at 70.85 marks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile shares in carmaker Volkswagen ignored news that German courts had dismissed its law suit against Opel, a unit of U.S. firm General Motors. VW shares rose 10.75 marks, or 1.8 percent, to 600.75 marks in bourse dealings.</p>
<p>VW had sought 10 million marks in the suit, which was the latest twist in the ongoing legal battle between the two carmakers over charges top GM officials left for VW in 1993 and brought along trade secrets.</p>
<p>VW, Europe's largest carmaker, has denied the charges brought by GM in a U.S. lawsuit.</p>
<p>Dealers called the stock's rise &quot;illogical&quot; and said it should have been hurt by the news of the dismissal of the law suit. &quot;VW is probably the new play-thing of the stock market after it lost SAP,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>Business software firm SAP had been the darling of the bourse, but plummeted last week after a profits warning.</p>
