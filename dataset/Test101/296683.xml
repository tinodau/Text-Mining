<headline>VW, GM said near settlement of Lopez case.</headline>

<p>Volkswagen AG's supervisory board has agreed in principle to settle a nearly four-year-old dispute with General Motors Corp. over allegations of industrial spying, sources close to VW said Thursday.</p>
<p>But it has not yet finalised a deal with the world's largest automaker, the sources said.</p>
<p>The German automaker's board met for about an hour Thursday and discussed specific proposals to end the dispute over allegations that former VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez stole secrets when he quit GM, according to sources in the Lower Saxony state government, which owns 20 percent of VW.</p>
<p>Secret talks between VW and GM, which have centred on VW agreeing to retract statements made about GM and its German subsidiary, Adam Opel AG, have not yet been completed.</p>
<p>But sources for both automakers said an out-of-court settlement between VW and its biggest rival in Europe could be announced as soon as Friday, with both sides apparently wanting to end the dispute without harming their brand images or sales in a lengthy fight.</p>
<p>One source close to the talks said there had been &quot;real progress in settlement discussions&quot; since VW was prepared to publicly retract statements that GM and Adam Opel might have manipulated or falsified evidence later collected by German prosecutors.</p>
<p>VW has also apparently agreed to retract suggestions by top VW officials that GM had organised an attack against Germany as an economic centre.</p>
<p>&quot;This has prepared the basis to go further,&quot; the source said. &quot;You can assume the talks are ongoing and are intensive.&quot;</p>
<p>Previous attempts to end the dispute have failed because VW had refused to retract the statements, according to GM sources.</p>
<p>Both automakers declined to comment officially on the talks. But after months of heated exchanges, they made conciliatory noises Thursday as speculation about a possible deal sent VW shares surging on the Frankfurt stock market, where they rose to a record.</p>
<p>Hans Wilhelm Gaeb, a vice president at GM's European headquarters in Zurich, said GM was committed to being a &quot;fair player&quot; with VW and reiterated that its dispute targeted a handful of VW officials, not the company itself.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always made clear that we have respect for VW. We have not wanted to damage VW as a firm. We had to take the legal action in Detroit to get this issue moved,&quot; Gaeb said.</p>
<p>VW spokesman Klaus Kocks, who once said he loved to get the blood pressure boiling at GM, welcomed Gaeb's comments.</p>
<p>The two automakers began new talks in early January to end the dispute, which is centred on a Detroit federal court lawsuit in which GM charged VW and some top executives with racketeering for luring away Lopez in March 1993.</p>
<p>In the suit, which names VW management board Chairman Ferdinand Piech as a defendant, GM alleges Lopez stole thousands of GM documents on a new factory as well as parts data for existing GM vehicles and those under development.</p>
<p>Lopez quit the VW management board in late November, a condition set by GM for any settlement talks, shortly before German prosecutors filed criminal charges against him and three other executives accused of bringing the documents to VW.</p>
<p>But German prosecutors said they found insufficient evidence of a conspiracy between senior VW managers and Lopez, who could face up to five years in prison if convicted.</p>
<p>VW has been under intense pressure to settle the dispute since GM was expected to demand damages of billions of dollars because it claimed Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, used the data to cut 1 billion marks ($635 million) in costs at VW.</p>
<p>A lawsuit award by a jury would be tripled under a U.S. racketeering law first used to fight organised crime.</p>
<p>The source said GM was still committed to receiving damages, calling it a matter of principle. But the source added: &quot;The amount to be claimed is subject to the atmosphere of the discussions and that the other conditions be met.&quot;</p>
<p>Sources have said any damages to GM might include a deal for VW to cooperate on joint ventures in emerging markets, such as China, where VW is strong, or for VW to buy parts from GM.</p>
