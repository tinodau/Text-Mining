<p>The FBI arrested one of its own agents, Earl Edwin Pitts, on espionage charges on Wednesday for allegedly passing sensitive classified documents to Russia since 1987 in exchange for more than $224,000.</p>
<p>Pitts, 43, who once worked in the New York FBI unit responsible for catching spies, was arrested at work at the FBI's training facility in Quantico, Virginia, and appeared in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>He was charged with attempted espionage, conspiracy to commit espionage, communication of classified information and conveyance without authority of government property. Federal Judge Thomas Rawles Jones ordered that Pitts be held in jail pending a bail hearing, set tentatively for Friday.</p>
<p>A slightly built man with close-cropped brown hair, Pitts showed no emotion as the judge informed him of his rights and the maximum penalty in the case, which is life imprisonment or the death penalty if certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>Officials described it as a serious case, worse than the one last month when CIA officer Harold Nicholson was arrested on charges of spying for Russia. Pitts appeared on Wednesday in the same courtroom where Nicholson was charged earlier.</p>
<p>Nicholson, a 16-year CIA veteran who had been chief of station in Romania and deputy chief in Malaysia, was accused of spying for Moscow since June, 1994, in exchange for about $180,000. The highest-ranking CIA officer ever indicted for espionage, he has pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>An FBI affadavit alleged that Pitts conspired with Russian spies from July 1987 through the present -- although he went into a &quot;dormant&quot; capacity in 1992 -- and that he received more than $224,000 from the Russians.</p>
<p>It said he gave the Russians sensitive classified documents on U.S. national defence and personal, medical, and family information about other FBI agents and proposed strategies by which Russia might recruit additional agents.</p>
<p>He also allegedly made plans to smuggle a Russian intelligence technical expert into the FBI academy and gave his Russian handlers an FBI cipher lock combination, an FBI key and his own FBI identification badge.</p>
<p>Pitts, who joined the FBI in 1983, was transferred from New York to be a supervisory special agent at FBI headquarters in the early 1990s. Officials said he was moved to the FBI training facility in 1995 after falling under suspicion.</p>
<p>Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh called a news conference at 2:30 P.M. (1930 GMT) at FBI headquarters to discuss the case.</p>
<p>The most serious FBI espionage case previously involved Richard Miller, an agent in Los Angeles who was arrested in 1984 on charges of spying for Moscow. He later was convicted.</p>
<p>Washington has long suspected that Moscow might have more spies operating in this country after the arrest in 1994 of Aldrich Ames, the confessed CIA turncoat who betrayed numerous agents and passed along some of the nation's most sensitive secrets. But officials said the damage from the FBI case did not appear as great as the Ames case.</p>
