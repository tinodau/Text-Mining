<headline>Egypt jails alleged Israel spy for 45 days more.</headline>
<dateline>CAIRO 1997-02-04</dateline>

<p>A Cairo court remanded an Egyptian man in custody for another 45 days while the prosecutor investigates allegations that he was part of an Israeli spy ring, security sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In November, Egyptian security forces arrested Emaddedin Abdel Hamid along with alleged Israeli spy Azam Azam who is also in detention. They are now looking for two Arab-Israeli women also implicated in the case.</p>
<p>Both men, who deny the espionage allegations, have not been formally charged and no date has been set for a trial.</p>
<p>The prosecutor has said that Azam had facilitated a sexual affair between Abdel Hamid and one of the women who later recruited him. Among prosecution evidence were clothes said to produce invisible ink when washed.</p>
<p>Israel has insisted that Azam is innocent and demands his release. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak says that he is a spy and that Israel squandered the chance to secure his release through quiet diplomacy by making the affair public.</p>
<p>Egypt in 1979 became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel but ties have cooled sharply since right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June.</p>
<p>The prosecutor is also holding in detention another Egyptian man who allegedly sold military information to the Mossad, the Israeli secret service.</p>
