<title>GERMANY: German DAX still on recovery track at opening.</title>
<headline>German DAX still on recovery track at opening.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-12-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>A reassuring overnight rebound on Wall Street, steady Bunds and a stable dollar helped the German share market post further gains in early dealings on Tuesday, and many dealers expected the trend to continue.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index started bourse trade up 30.58 points at 2,887.82 points, further paring losses from Friday after Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan sent global markets tumbling with his warnings against excessive market exuberance.</p>
<p>&quot;The market factors are all there,&quot; said one Frankfurt dealer. &quot;I think we are back on track.&quot;</p>
<p>Although some dealers said there was still a lot of nervousness in the market, a move past the 2,900 level, which the DAX had reached for the first time last week, should trigger renewed buying interest.</p>
<p>&quot;If we hit 2,900 points, then we will be chasing 3,000,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>Technical factors dominated dealings, boosting chemical stocks which had taken a beating last week. But the ongoing feud between German carmaker Volkswagen AG and U.S. rival General Motors Corp was continuing to attract attention.</p>
<p>VW started out up five marks at 608 after its chief executive Ferdinand Piech appeared to take a more conciliatory note by expressing regret over the cost and trouble caused to both sides by the feud.</p>
<p>VW has been embroiled in a battle with GM over alleged industrial espionage by Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, once a top level GM executive who transferred to VW in 1993. Lopez resigned from VW in late November.</p>
