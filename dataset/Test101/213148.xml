<p>Lawyers representing Volkswagen AG manager Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua said on Saturday that a court in Frankfurt ruled on Friday they would have to hand over key documents at the request of the U.S.</p>
<p>A spokesman for lawyer Juergen Toschke, who is representing the VW manager accused of industrial espionage, said the court had ruled that certain documents must be made available to U.S. authorities if requested by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Justice Department.  </p>
<p>The ruling, which was intitially concealed after Friday's court session, applied to a study by auditors KPMG, the protocol of witnesses statements and the statement of the defence, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has asked for documents on Lopez, VW's production chief de Arriortua and other suspects in a legal fight against VW's rival Opel AG.</p>
<p>Lopez, a Spaniard, is being probed by German authorities for allegedly taking along secret documents when he quit Opel and parent company General Motors Corp in 1993 to join VW.  </p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors began an investigation shortly after Lopez and three of his associates joined VW and made the request for the German documents more than two years ago.</p>
<p>Court spokesman Wolfgang Frank said on Friday the decision was being sent to the parties involved before being made public.</p>
<p>VW has fought the document transfer by saying the rights of Lopez and other suspects would be violated and that German courts should have jurisdiction over the overall issue.  </p>
<p>Lopez's German lawyer said earlier in November that he expected German prosecutors in Darmstadt to soon file criminal charges related to industrial spying against his client. Prosecutors have said a decision would be made by year-end.</p>
<p>If the Frankfurt court complies with the U.S. request for the information, the files could be put before a U.S. grand jury in Detroit, the hometown of GM, that is also investigating the abrupt switch of Lopez and other executives to Volkswagen.  </p>
<p>VW has suffered a series of legal setbacks in recent weeks, including a U.S. district court in Detroit rejecting VW's attempts to have the lawsuit -- which include racketeering charges based on organised crime statutes -- dismissed.</p>
<p>In addition to Lopez, the U.S. lawsuit filed by GM names, among others, VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech.</p>
<p>The Detroit federal court is scheduled to issue a written decision by November 26 on the inclusion of the racketeering charges, which are based on RICO statutes initially used to fight the mafia and whose use has been expanded.  </p>
<p>Legal experts familiar with U.S. civil lawsuits said GM getting a U.S. jury verdict in its favour on racketeering charges could see the carmaker facing hefty damages.</p>
