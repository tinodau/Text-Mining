<p>Volkswagen AG production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua is likely to resign on Friday amid a three-year industrial espionage row with General Motors, sources close to VW said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Lopez, accused by GM of stealing secret documents when he defected to VW from the U.S. car giant in 1993, is likely to offer his resignation at a supervisory board meeting, the sources told Reuters.</p>
<p>VW, which has come under mounting pressure in recent weeks to reach an out-of-court settlement with GM, declined to comment on the matter.</p>
<p>&quot;To spare you the frustrating telephone calls, here is the following advisory: no (repeat no) statement is to be expected from us today,&quot; VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said in a news release distributed on Thursday in response to a report in Handelsblatt newspaper that Lopez was likely to resign.</p>
<p>VW's supervisory board was scheduled to meet on Friday at 0800 GMT. The board's central committee was due to meet on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>VW on Wednesday rejected a demand by Opel that it should sack Lopez, apologise, and offer compensation in return for an out-of-court settlement in a U.S. civil lawsuit filed by Opel and GM earlier this year.</p>
<p>Handelsblatt, citing &quot;well-informed&quot; sources, said VW's supervisory board would not dishonourably dismiss Lopez.</p>
<p>GM alleges that Lopez and three other former GM executives now at VW stole secret documents on purchasing and car production plans when they moved to VW.</p>
<p>VW has consistently denied the accusations and given Lopez its full backing. But pressure on the carmaker has been mounting following several adverse court decisions over recent weeks in its legal battle.</p>
<p>On Tuesday a U.S. judge in Detroit, GM's home town, ruled GM could pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and other VW executives, including board chairman Ferdinand Piech.</p>
<p>Allowing the racketeering charges trebles the amount of compensation VW would have to pay if found guilty. Industry sources say VW may have to pay billions of dollars in compensation.</p>
<p>VW suffered another blow last week when a Frankfurt court ruled that lawyers representing Lopez would have to hand over key documents at the request of the U.S. authorities.</p>
<p>And Lopez' own lawyers have said they expect German prosecutors to file criminal charges of industrial spying in a German court by the end of November.</p>
<p>Both VW and Opel have officially denied media reports that they have been negotiating an out-of-court settlement, but industry sources say there have been contacts between the carmakers on the matter recently.</p>
