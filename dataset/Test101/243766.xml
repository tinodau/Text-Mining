<headline>Volkswagen apology not enough for fresh talks - GM.</headline>

<p>Germany's Volkswagen apologised on Monday to General Motors to try to make amends for &quot;trouble and costs&quot; over an industrial espionage scandal, but the giant U.S. car maker said it was not enough.</p>
<p>VW's chief executive, Ferdinand Piech said fresh talks now with GM could end a nearly four-year legal battle, pitting two of the world's giant carmakers.</p>
<p>Piech told journalists at a Volkswagen AG event in the French-German border city of Colmar that VW may consider resuming purchase of parts from General Motors Corp and its German subsidiary, Adam Opel AG.</p>
<p>He expressed regret for the &quot;turmoil, trouble and costs resulting for both companies&quot; over production guru, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua's transfer to the German automaker.</p>
<p>But he said the transfer of Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, to VW was &quot;fully legal&quot; and did not comment directly on allegations Lopez and seven other former GM associates stole secret documents when they quit the U.S. automaker.</p>
<p>A GM official said Piech's comments were insufficient to bring about new settlement talks saying that the German carmaker had to admit to wrongdoing.</p>
<p>&quot;It does not meet our conditions,&quot; the GM official said. &quot;Our conditions are that VW acknowledge the wrongdoing, sever all ties with Lopez and his collaborators and compensate GM and Opel for the damages. Regret alone will not be sufficient.&quot;</p>
<p>GM alleges that Lopez used the secret information from GM to cut some 700 million marks ($450.9 million) of costs at VW, quickly eroding a 20 percent cost advantage that Opel had over its German rival.</p>
<p>Piech, the grandson of VW founder Ferdinand Porsche, had long said he would not apologise to GM over its allegations that VW lured away Lopez and others who brought along secret plans on car parts pricing and innovative factory plans.</p>
<p>But Piech's statement appeared aimed at meeting one of the strict conditions that GM has laid out before it would consider any deal to end its U.S. lawsuit accusing VW of racketeering.</p>
<p>GM officials have said VW has missed previous chances to de-escalate the fight, including the resignation of Lopez and attempts to strike a new concilatory tone with GM.</p>
<p>Signs of progress in the dispute appeared in late November when Lopez quit the VW management board. But Lopez was replaced by Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, 39, who is also named as a defendant in the U.S. racketeering lawsuit that also lists Piech and other top VW executives as defendants.</p>
<p>Piech also said at the time that he would welcome the chance to keep working with Lopez as a consultant, which irked GM officials, and VW also agreed to pay Lopez four million marks for the balance of his contract through March 1998.</p>
<p>But Piech said he believed new talks to settle the lawsuit could resume after German prosecutors file criminal charges against Lopez, possibly as soon as this week.</p>
<p>Lopez's German lawyer has said he expects prosecutors in the suburban Frankfurt city of Darmstadt to file the charges against his client by year-end. Sources have said charges would likely be made public against Lopez in the coming days.</p>
<p>In addition, Piech said the last remaining demand by GM -- that VW pay damages for the theft of documents, including pricing data on some 110,000 parts -- was not a primary issue.</p>
<p>&quot;The demand for damages was for both sides so far in all talks the least important point,&quot; Piech said.</p>
<p>He said one part of the negotiations, which were last held secretly in London in September, could be VW agreeing to buy parts from GM or its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Piech said business relations with GM had been dormant for the last three years. Before that, Piech said VW bought up to 100 million marks per year from GM before the Lopez transfer.</p>
<p>VW has sought to strike the conciliatory tone after it lost a series of legal fights in the United States and risks facing a jury verdict totalling billions of dollars since the racketeering law, first used to fight the mafia, calls for damages to be tripled. ($1=1.5522 Mark)</p>
