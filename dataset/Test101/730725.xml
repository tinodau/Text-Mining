<p>At least 60 people died after a ferry carrying 200 passengers sank in lake Toba, a tourist resort in Indonesia's north Sumatra province, police said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The latest information we have this morning shows that 60 people died in the accident on Sunday night. There could be more victims as the search continues,&quot; a policeman in Tarutung town told Reuters by telephone. Earlier reports said the accident was on Monday night.</p>
<p>&quot;The boat, K.M. Peldatari, carried at least 200 people, which is far above its limit of between 50 and 60 passengers,&quot; the policeman said.</p>
<p>He said the wooden vessel sank on its way from Parapat on the shore of lake Toba to Tomok on Samosir island, which is in the middle of the lake.</p>
<p>He declined to give further details and it was not known if there were any foreigners among the passengers.</p>
<p>The official Antara news agency reported on Tuesday the passengers were returning to the island after attending an annual local cultural festival in Parapat.</p>
<p>The agency quoted survivors as saying they heard loud cracking noises before the boat sank.</p>
<p>&quot;Water quickly came into the boat, so the passengers who were mostly teenagers jumped into the lake, which is 800 metres (2,600 feet) deep,&quot; the agency said.</p>
