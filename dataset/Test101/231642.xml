<p>Adam Opel AG, saying relations with Volkswagen AG have worsened even more, demanded on Tuesday that VW slash ties with executives linked to its allegations of industrial spying before any settlement can be reached.</p>
<p>Opel chief executive David Herman told Reuters in an interview that &quot;an opportunity to move forward&quot; was lost when VW accepted the resignation of VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua but said he might stay on as a consultant.</p>
<p>Herman said no settlement talks are currently being held with VW and that none were currently scheduled.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no chance right now to go forward,&quot; Herman said.</p>
<p>Opel, a unit of General Motors Corp, has set conditions for a settlement with VW in its U.S. civil court lawsuit -- Lopez and other collaborators must leave VW, a public acknowledgement of error must be issued and VW must pay damages.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation has gotten worse,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not accept that Lopez directs any actions on behalf of their company from the outside and that all people that we alleged to be in the conspiracy are still working there and making use of our company information,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>VW spokesman Klaus Kocks declined to comment on Herman's statements but said VW stood by its commitment to enter any negotiations without any preconditions.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always said that we are ready to talk but without any preconditions,&quot; Kocks told Reuters. &quot;Right now, we agree to disagree on the general judgment of what happened. The point is that no damage has been done and there will be no money.&quot;</p>
<p>Opel was incensed that VW has ignored its demand for Lopez and at least seven other former GM executives who followed him to Volkswagen in March 1993 to be forced out for allegedly taking along production and purchasing secret document.</p>
<p>Lopez, who announced his resignation on Friday, will receive about four million marks in compensation and VW management board chairman Ferdinand Peich said he would welcome the chance to keep on working with Lopez as a consultant.</p>
<p>In addition, one of Lopez's protogees and a former GM employee, Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, 39, who is a defendant in the U.S. lawsuit, has been named to replace Lopez.</p>
<p>&quot;That certainly does not satisfy any of the conditions,&quot; Opel's Herman said.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't improve the situation if Lopez continues along the same route from another office. He would still be working for VW and using information stolen from us,&quot; Herman said.</p>
<p>Herman dismissed speculation that Opel has put a potential jury verdict payout for Volkswagen in the U.S. civil court lawsuit at several billion dollars, saying a decision on what to seek in any jury trial is still under consideration.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not yet specified the amount to seek. It is irresponsible for people to stick their finger in the air and say what is a fair assessment,&quot; Herman said.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe our claims in the U.S. and Germany have a substantial basis. We will win those cases and it could lead to a substantially high amount of damages,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;What the right amount will be is something that will come out of a full analysis of the facts, including the results of the discovery phase of the lawsuit,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed Opel would consider a deal but prior talks, which he said have not been held for some time, have failed.</p>
<p>&quot;There has not even been an agreement on the conditions for a settlement nor discussions at this time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said one sticking point was getting VW to apologise for statements made by top VW officials at the outset of the fight between the two carmakers, including allegations by German politicans that the United States wanted to start &quot;an economic war&quot; with Germany and that GM and Opel were doing it.</p>
<p>Herman noted that GM and Opel -- which are the No. 2 carmakers in Europe behind VW -- were aware how far they could push VW in the legal battle without its public image suffering.</p>
<p>&quot;We are conscious of the necessity that whatever happens the parties must be able to live and work together in the German community in the future,&quot; Herman said.</p>
<p>Herman also dismissed speculation from industry observers that there was a rift between Opel's German headquarters and top GM executives in Detroit on how to proceed with the case.</p>
<p>&quot;That is preposterous,&quot; he said. &quot;It is not logical and certainly not correct to give the impression that anything we are doing does not represent the studied position of all concerned within our corporation.&quot;</p>
