<p>British writers gathered outside the Iranian embassy in London on Monday, calling for the release of jailed newspaper editor Faraj Sarkuhi.</p>
<p>Around 40 demonstrators, including authors Rachel Billington and Richard Holroyd, waved banners demanding the Iranian authorities free Sarkuhi, who was arrested in April trying to leave Iran illegally.</p>
<p>The only reaction from the embassy was to turn security cameras towards the group.</p>
<p>Organised by PEN, an international club for writers, the protest was the latest in a long campaign of weekly demonstrations and open letters to the Tehran government.</p>
<p>Concern has been mounting among human rights groups since Iran said Sarkuhi was to be tried for espionage.</p>
<p>As rumours swirled over Sarkuhi's whereabouts, PEN said it believed an additional charge of adultery has now been laid.</p>
<p>Both espionage and adultery are punishable by death in Iran.</p>
<p>Some campaigners said they were optimistic Sarkuhi may be spared under Iran's new President Khatemi who committed himself to freedom of expression and human rights in his election campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;We're hoping President Khatami will be more lenient,&quot; said PEN chairman Morris Farhi. &quot;If Sarkuhi is still alive, this may be an indication of Khatami's good intentions.</p>
<p>However PEN's president, Josephine Pullein-Thompson said she believed Islamic fundamentalists in Iran would still have the final say.</p>
<p>Sarkuhi was editor of the monthly Adineh (Friday) newspaper before disappearing last November. His wife, who lives in Germany with their two children, said earlier this year she feared he was being held as a bargaining chip after Germany accused Iran of being behind the 1992 killing of four Kurdish dissidents in Berlin.</p>
<p>A letter allegedly written by Sarkuhi says he was held for six weeks by the Iranian secret service and forced under torture to confess to spying for Germany.</p>
