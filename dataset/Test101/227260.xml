<p>A Mongolian parliamentary committee said it had found evidence to back allegations that Mongolia's shadowy spymasters, the Centre for Espionage, had conducted illegal surveillance of the opposition.</p>
<p>The Centre for Espionage, known in Mongolian as the TTG, had bugged telephones of the opposition and was suspected of conducting other unspecified activities, a spokesman for the group of parliamentary investigators told a news conference late on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;These activities have been proved by written documents and witnesses,&quot; T. Nyamdorj told reporters.</p>
<p>The Centre for Espionage issued a rare statement last week denying allegations by the ex-communist Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP), which ruled until elections last June, that it had spied on the new opposition. However, it admitted spying on reporters under the former MPRP government.</p>
<p>MPRP officials have in recent weeks accused Mongolia's new government of democratic reformers of using the centre's agents to spy on the opposition for political gain and have demanded the resignation of Prime Minister M. Enkhsaikhan.</p>
<p>All the investigators, members of parliament from the ruling Democratic Union Coalition, the MPRP and the tiny National Unity Party, had agreed that there was evidence of recent violations of the law by the centre, Nyamdorj said.</p>
<p>The evidence showed the Centre for Espionage had listened in on MPRP General Secretary N. Enkhbayar's telephone calls but attempts to bug the phone of former prime minister P. Jasrai had failed due to technical reasons, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not clear what lies behind this,&quot; Nyamdorj said, referring to other suspected cases. &quot;People who are in charge of this do not respond and do not show the documents.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked whether Prime Minister M. Enkhsaikhan had ordered the illegal activities, he said: &quot;There is no such document.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The leader of the TTG has the right to conduct investigations independently,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Nyamdorj said investigators had recommended the government dismiss the head of the TTG, J. Baatar, and &quot;take all measures to ensure that the TTG...is not carrying out illegal activities&quot;.</p>
<p>The investigators had briefed the prime minister and the parliament speaker on Friday evening, Nyamdorj said.</p>
<p>&quot;The government has not yet responded,&quot; he said. &quot;On such an issue, it is necessary that the state takes action fast and with courage,&quot; he said.</p>
