<p>Volkswagen AG said on Monday it had asked German prosecutors to investigate growing bribery allegations tied to a major paint factory contract for its Czech Skoda unit awarded to Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri .</p>
<p>VW said it filed the legal complaint on Friday to start the criminal probe into allegations that some VW workers demanded about 20 million marks in bribes from ABB in exchange for the 400 million mark plant expansion contract.</p>
<p>The request to prosecutors in Braunschweig came as Der Spiegel magazine said a group of workers at VW and General Motors Corp for years have sought and received hundreds of millions of marks in bribes from several parts suppliers.</p>
<p>The allegations add to the mounting troubles for Volkswagen, emerging only a few weeks after VW agreed to end GM's lawsuit charging that former GM executive Jose Ignacio Lopez had stolen thousands of secret documents when he left to join VW in March 1993.</p>
<p>VW sought to solve its troubles over Lopez, credited with returning VW to profitability, by agreeing to pay GM about $100 million and buy $1 billion of parts over the next seven years.</p>
<p>Swiss prosecutor Urs Hubmann said on Monday that he questioned two people last week as part of the probe, which was requested by ABB after the allegations surfaced in January.</p>
<p>But Hubmann declined to identify the people who were questioned in Zurich and would not confirm or deny the details of the Spiegel report.</p>
<p>The report said funds from such bribes, which were demanded during negotiations for contracts, were allegedly paid to shell companies in Luxembourg, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.</p>
<p>A VW spokesman declined to comment directly on the allegations made in the magazine report, saying the German carmaker would cooperate with the various investigations.</p>
<p>An ABB spokesman in Zurich on Monday also declined to comment on the Spiegel allegations about a gang of bribe-takers dubbed &quot;the Network&quot;, saying ABB had contacted prosecutors in Switzerland and Germany for help and that it has given full information to VW to help with their own internal probe.</p>
<p>&quot;It is in the hands of the legal authorities completely now,&quot; spokesman Michael Robertson told Reuters. &quot;We do not want to comment in any way that could disturb their investigations.&quot;</p>
<p>An official at GM's European office in Zurich said the U.S. auto giant was monitoring the investigation and that it would contact public prosecutors if it suspected any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The official said GM executives did not meet with VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech at the recent World Economic Summit in Davos, saying, &quot;There have been no discussions with VW managers or with Piech on such an issue.&quot;</p>
