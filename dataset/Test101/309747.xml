<p>Security forces in northwestern Iran have arrested six people on charges of spying for unnamed foreign countries, the official Iranian news agency IRNA said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It quoted the leading internal security official in West Azerbaijan province as saying the six had confessed to spying by providing &quot;foreign elements...with films and pictures of strategic and military areas (and) assisting these elements in their sabotage operations&quot;.</p>
<p>Those arrested had also provided &quot;political, economic and cultural information&quot;, said the official, who did not name the foreign countries alleged to be involved.</p>
<p>Iran last year said it had broken up several spy rings in the area, some of which it said were led by Turkish diplomats. Turkey denied the charges.</p>
<p>Tehran earlier this month executed two men for spying for Israel and the United States and committing economic sabotage.</p>
<p>Iran last year started enforcing a new Islamic penal code which imposes the death sentence for anyone providing confidential information to foreigners, especially the United States and Israel, or to opposition groups fighting to overthrow the government.</p>
