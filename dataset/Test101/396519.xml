<headline>VW tries to clear up alleged &quot;swamp of corruption&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>WOLFSBURG, Germany 1997-02-23</dateline>

<p>German carmaker Volkswagen AG said on Sunday it would do everything in its power to clear up allegations of widespread corruption in the German car industry.</p>
<p>&quot;VW wants to clear up a possible swamp of corruption in the supplies sector,&quot; VW spokesman Klaus Kocks told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said VW had urged suppliers, including Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB, to initiate legal proceedings where necessary to clarify the corruption charges, which could have a negative affect on the whole German car industry.</p>
<p>ABB filed charges related to the case earlier this month.</p>
<p>Kocks declined comment on details of a report in Spiegel magazine which said former senior VW managers were implicated in a network of corruption, with purchasing managers allegedly receiving multi-million mark kickbacks from suppliers.</p>
<p>But he did say VW would present further findings of its own internal investigations to public prosecutors in Braunschweig on Monday.</p>
<p>VW said on Thursday it had fired a purchasing department department employee and that he had been placed in investigative custody by German public prosecutors.</p>
<p>The carmaker said the man was recently dismissed for allegedly submitting falsified or unwarranted contracts after they were discovered during an internal probe.</p>
<p>Kocks promised a &quot;comprehensive explanation&quot; of corruption allegations in a statement to be released on Wednesday at 1030 GMT.</p>
<p>The VW spokesman welcomed legal proceedings initiated in Braunschweig and Zurich by ABB and said: &quot;We need results which can be used in court.&quot;</p>
<p>He said that the findings of VW's internal enquiry had in some cases been gathered by private investigators.</p>
<p>The Spiegel report, released in advance of publication, pointed to a &quot;network&quot; of purchasing managers at both VW and General Motors who over years had amassed millions of marks in kickbacks from suppliers.</p>
<p>Kocks said there was still no evidence of a network conspiracy among purchasing employees. &quot;At the moment we can only see the pieces of the mosaic, not the whole picture.&quot;</p>
<p>There was no evidence of any involvement by the group's former purchasing manager Jose Ignacio Lopez, he said.</p>
<p>VW is currently investigating a series of possible corruption cases among its suppliers, including allegations that some suppliers charged higher invoices so as to cream off some of the excess cash.</p>
