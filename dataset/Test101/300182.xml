<headline>Hometown still supports VW cost-cutter Lopez.</headline>

<p>Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the man at the centre of a long and bitter battle between two of the world's car making giants, is accused of industrial espionage and is one of the world's toughest cost-cutters.</p>
<p>Lopez ruthlessly redefined supply relations at U.S. car giant General Motors and went on to use his revolutionary principles to put Germany's Volkswagen AG back into profit.</p>
<p>His talents earned him the nickname of &quot;Superlopez&quot; but his reputation was tainted by allegations that he took industrial secrets on purchasing and car-production when he defected to VW from General Motors in early 1993.</p>
<p>But many in his home town of Amorebieta in Spain see him in a more positive light and still hope he will help set up a car factory there.</p>
<p>Lopez has denied the allegations but was forced to resign from his job late last year as a result of the fight and on Thursday the two companies came to terms.</p>
<p>The settlement calls for VW to pay GM $100 million, buy some $1 billion worth of GM car parts over a seven-year period and retract statements made about the U.S. car maker.</p>
<p>In return, GM has agreed to drop all civil litigation against VW, including its racketeering lawsuit filed in a Detroit federal court, which had threatened VW with a potential jury damages verdict in the billions of dollars.</p>
<p>VW said late on Thursday that it &quot;acknowledges the possibility that illegal activities by the individuals may have occurred. These allegations remain to be proven or disproven.&quot;</p>
<p>The trouble has not dimmed the strong feelings of support the 16,000 people of Amorebieta hold for Lopez however, who himself has always denied the charges.</p>
<p>&quot;Our village follows the news about the accusations against Jose Ignacio with a lot of interest but we are confident that it will be resolved,&quot; said boyhood friend Jaime Fernandez Amar in the town of Amorebieta, 400 km (248.5 miles) north of Madrid.</p>
<p>Lopez, married to a Basque woman for 27 years, continues to visit the town and his mother, who lives in a modest flat.</p>
<p>Many count on Lopez's love of his homeland and his know-how to help revive his town's industrial aspirations and save it from becoming a bedroom community for nearby Bilbao.</p>
<p>They hope he will help set up a car factory here.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a man of his town, a hard worker who has always achieved what he wanted,&quot; said a local journalist.</p>
<p>But Volkswagen discarded initial plans to build a factory in Amorebieta in 1993. A second project, to open a truck plant, also failed to materialise when VW opted for Brazil.</p>
<p>However, the provincial government of Vizcaya says talks with the German automaker have been reopened and it has reserved one million square metres of land should they end well.</p>
<p>&quot;Knowing him, I can vouch that he has never done anything against his conscience,&quot; said the journalist.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything they said he robbed he did not need to take because he had it in his head. They were his own ideas.&quot;</p>
