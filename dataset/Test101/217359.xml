<p>A federal judge ruled Tuesday that General Motors Corp.'s industrial espionage lawsuit against Volkswagen AG can proceed under U.S. racketeering law, opening the German automaker to much higher potential damages.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds, in a written order, denied VW's motion to dismiss GM's claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). It was the latest in a series of blows the judge has dealt to VW in the case.</p>
<p>If a jury finds that VW fiancially damaged GM through the theft of trade secrets, VW could face triple damages under the RICO law, leading to a potential payout in the billions of dollars, industry sources said.</p>
<p>&quot;This certainly increases the potential recovery for GM, so it enhances the settlement value,&quot; said Patrick Keenan, a law professor at the University of Detroit Mercy. &quot;The purpose of RICO is to add one more big hammer to GM's case.&quot;</p>
<p>In a long-running saga, GM has accused its fiery former purchasing chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and others of stealing confidential documents when they left GM to join VW in March 1993.</p>
<p>GM claims the stolen data, which included product plans, parts prices and super-efficient manufacturing techniques, unfairly allowed VW to slash its costs, causing GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG, unspecified financial damages.</p>
<p>The RICO statute, which has been widely used to prosecute organized crime in the United States, is aimed at thwarting conspiracies and enterprises that engage in a pattern of fraud or other criminal racketeering activities.</p>
<p>GM based its RICO claim on allegations that Lopez, VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech and other top executives conspired to steal the GM secrets and profit from them. GM said they used VW's corporate jet to transport the documents to VW's guest villa in Wolfsburg, Germany, where the documents were copied into VW computers and shredded.</p>
<p>While Edmunds did not consider the merits of GM's claims, she said they warranted further consideration under the RICO statute.</p>
<p>&quot;Although the complaint only alleges two victims, GM and Opel, the compaint alleges multiple schemes and multiple predicate acts,&quot; Edmunds wrote in the order.</p>
<p>Reacting to the ruling, GM said in a statement that Edmunds' order meant its most serious allegations would be presented in open court with witnesses under oath.</p>
<p>&quot;It also means that we are yet another step closer to a remedy for the substantial damages we suffered when Lopez was lured away from GM and defected to VW with our trade secrets,&quot; GM spokesman John Mueller said.</p>
<p>He declined to comment on media reports in recent days that VW has held secret talks with GM about settling the case. Volkswagen also has declined to comment on the reports.</p>
<p>But industry sources in Germany said the increasing threat of a U.S. judgment against VW has prompted more talks between the two companies.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation for VW is so threatening that they are trying to demonstrate to their shareholders that they are seeking to limit the damages,&quot; said one source, who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>In addition, Lopez and other executives who followed him to VW remain the focus of criminal investigations in the United States and Germany. Lopez' lawyer said in February that he expected German prosecutors to soon file criminal charges against him.</p>
<p>In August 1993, Opel said any settlement of the matter would have to include a public apology, the resignation of Lopez and a substantial payout for damages to the automaker.</p>
<p>VW's lead U.S. attorney, James Denvir, said in a statement that Edmunds' ruling &quot;has nothing to do with the merits of the allegations, but merely whether they are legally sufficient, being taken as true, to state a claim.&quot;</p>
<p>Edmunds is expected to meet with GM and VW lawyers in the case on Dec. 5 to set a schedule for disclosure of facts and evidence before the case goes to trial.</p>
<p>GM stock rose 12.5 cents to $58.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
