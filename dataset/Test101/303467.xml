<p>General Motors Chairman Jack Smith acknowledged on Sunday that protecting the automaker's reputation and sales in Germany was one of the factors that caused it to settle its bitter industrial espionage dispute with Volkswagen AG.</p>
<p>Smith, speaking to reporters for the first time since the deal was struck on Thursday, also said GM would profit handsomely from the $100 million payment VW agreed to make as part of the settlement. According to preliminary estimates made by GM's lawyers, he said the automaker's legal fees associated with the dispute totaled about $7.5 million.</p>
<p>He said GM would expect to receive the cash within 60 to 90 days.</p>
<p>The landmark settlement calls for GM to drop its U.S. racketeering suit against VW, which accused former VW purchasing chief Jose Ignacio Lopez and others of stealing industrial secrets when they quit GM to join VW in 1993.</p>
<p>In addition to the $100 million payment VW agreed to purchase $1 billion worth of GM parts over the next seven years and retract statements such as charges that GM may have tampered with evidence before it was released to German prosecutors.</p>
<p>The deal, which ended one of the bitterest feuds in corporate history, eliminated the risk of a multibillion dollar jury verdict against VW in GM's hometown of Detroit.</p>
<p>&quot;We did have a strong case, but we were anxious to close out the case,&quot; Smith said. &quot;We're happy we got it behind us.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked if GM was worried that negative publicity surrounding the four-year-old dispute would damage the the reputation of its Adam Opel AG unit among German consumers, Smith said, &quot;All those factors are out there, you know, and its a combination of issues that you make your judgement of what to do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly Volkswagen wanted to get it settled and they thought it was an opportune time to put it to bed,&quot; Smith said.</p>
<p>In Germany on Sunday, VW reaffirmed its confidence in its chief executive, Ferdinand Piech, and pledged to extend his contract after the company last week settled a four-year-old feud with General Motors Corp.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, VW supervisory board head Klaus Liesen said: &quot;Piech helped to bring about the settlement and was fully behind carrying it through. There is no doubt that his contract will be extended.&quot;</p>
<p>Liesen's comments echoed fellow supervisory board member Gerhard Schroeder, who told the Koelner Stadt-Anzeiger on Saturday that Piech would stay with VW and said the German automaker's management was not to blame for the dispute with GM.</p>
<p>Relief that the dispute was over has been tempered in Germany by worries over the cost of the deal. Some shareholders warned this weekend that Piech and other top executives would face a grilling at the next shareholder meeting.</p>
<p>But supervisory board member Schroeder denied that the VW management had acted wrongly in the dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not feel damaged in any way. All decisions were agreed unanimously by the VW board and I have no reason to doubt these decisions in hindsight,&quot; Schroeder was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>VW said in December that it planned to extend Piech's contract, which expires on Jan., 1, 1998. Welt am Sonntag said an official ruling likely to extend it to 2003 would be made at a supervisory board meeting on March 21.</p>
<p>But German shareholder groups over the weekend criticized the settlement, saying the deal may be too costly for stockholders.</p>
<p>&quot;The question arises -- who is actually supposed to pay this $100 million?&quot; Reinhild Kreitel, spokeswoman for the German small shareholders' association, told Reuters.</p>
<p>While VW said the deal would not have a serious impact on its profits, Keitel said the shareholder lobby group was considering withholding support of VW management and the automaker's supervisory boards at the next shareholder meeting.</p>
<p>Ekkehard Wenger, founder of the German association for promotion of shareholder democracy, also said it would be unacceptable to expect small shareholders to pay for management errors.</p>
<p>&quot;The management board will have to come up with some explanations at the annual general meeting,&quot; he said in a telephone interview.</p>
