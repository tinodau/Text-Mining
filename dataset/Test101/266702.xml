<p>Russia said on Thursday it had no comment to make on the arrest of a U.S. agent on charges of spying for Moscow but warned against any attempt to use the incident to harm relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>The FBI arrested its own agent, Earl Edwin Pitts, on Wednesday for allegedly selling U.S. security secrets to Russia since 1987 for more than $224,000 in the second spy case to erupt in a month.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no statement to make and no information on this incident but I want to say that we are firmly opposed...to all attempts at artificially complicating relations between Russia and the United States,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Demurin told a regular news briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;We support the constructive development of relations between our two countries,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The FBI said the arrest of Pitts, a 13-year veteran, capped a 16-month undercover operation, with U.S. agents posing as Russian spies and the use of a former Russian officer at the United Nations in New York who later became an FBI informant.</p>
<p>It marked the second spy case to rock Washington and Moscow in a month. On November 18 the FBI arrested veteran CIA officer Harold Nicholson on charges of spying for Russia.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency on Thursday quoted Vyacheslav Trubnikov, the head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, as saying he suspected a political motive in its public unmasking of alleged Russian agents by the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;The overwhelming majority of such publications about the activity of Russian foreign intelligence carry specific political aims and have only an indirect relation to the intelligence itself,&quot; Tass quoted Trubnikov as saying.</p>
<p>He added that some circles abroad objected to Russia pursuing a more vigorous foreign policy, referring to Moscow's more nationalist stance in recent years after the initial euphoria that accompanied the fall of Soviet communism.</p>
<p>Earlier this week Russia itself complained of foreign espionage activity on its soil, saying it posed a major threat to national security despite the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p>The chief of the Federal Security Service (FSB), successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said his organisation had exposed some 400 employees of foreign intelligence organisations and 39 Russian citizens working for them in the past two years alone.</p>
<p>The FSB has also uncovered more than 100 attempts by Russian citizens to pass on intelligence to foreign organisations on their own initiative, Nikolai Kovalyov told reporters.</p>
<p>Trubnikov said it would be hypocritical for Russia to say it would cease all intelligence activity in foreign countries, including the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;Not a single, self-respecting state can exist without a secret service,&quot; Tass quoted him as saying. &quot;But there's no need to make drama out of this axiom.&quot;</p>
