<p>German carmaker Adam Opel AG declined comment on Monday on a report that rival Volkswagen is secretly talking with parent company General Motors Corp to reach a deal on charges of industrial spying.</p>
<p>Germany's Spiegel magazine reported at the weekend that VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen had met with GM executive committee board chairman John Smale in Detroit to consider an out-of-court settlement of the U.S. legal fight.</p>
<p>Volkswagen spokesman Klaus Kocks on Sunday would not comment on the report.</p>
<p>The reported talks sought to reach a deal on a U.S. civil lawsuit filed by GM against VW executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who is being probed for allegedly taking secret documents in 1993 from GM when he joined VW, and other top VW executives, including management board chief Ferdinand Piech.</p>
<p>The magazine reported that VW was seeking a deal with GM because recent court decisions relating to the U.S. court case, as well as a German criminal probe, have not gone in its favour.</p>
<p>VW could face damages of hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, if GM were to win the U.S. lawsuit in a Detroit federal court, which also names several other top VW executives as well as Lopez, industry sources said.</p>
<p>One industry source familiar with the lawsuit downplayed the chances for a quick settlement to the bitter fight between GM and VW which has dragged on for more than three years.</p>
<p>&quot;There are talks going on between the two over the lawsuits as well as about general industry issues but the threat against VW is rising,&quot; said the source, who asked not be identified.</p>
<p>&quot;I would not expect a settlement in the short-term but the chance for a deal is more in the middle- to longer-term period,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In addition to the U.S. lawsuit, Lopez's German lawyer also said in early November that he expected German prosecutors in Darmstadt to soon file criminal charges related to industrial spying against his client.</p>
<p>Lopez is also the target of a U.S. grand jury investigating allegations of criminal wrongdoing with his transfer to VW.</p>
<p>VW may soon suffer more bad news regarding the legal fight.</p>
<p>The Detroit court overseeing the U.S. lawsuit is set to reaffirm by Tuesday its decision to include against VW and Lopez racketeering charges which are based on laws initially used to fight the mafia and whose use has since been expanded.</p>
<p>Spiegel said VW sought the talks with American executives at the Detroit-based carmaker because they would be more willing to reach a deal than Opel management in Germany who have been closely involved in the legal battle.</p>
<p>The report follows a court judgement on Friday against VW that said evidence from the three-year German criminal investigation of Lopez and other former GM workers now at VW would be turned over to the U.S. Justice Department.</p>
<p>A spokesman for VW lawyer Juergen Toschke, who represents Lopez, said on Saturday that a Frankfurt appellate court has ruled in favour of turning over the documents. A confirmation of the court ruling was expected to be released on Monday.</p>
<p>The Justice Department some two years ago had requested the documents for its own criminal investigation before a U.S. grand jury in Detroit.</p>
<p>VW, which has denied the industrial spying charges, has fought the document transfer by saying the rights of Lopez and other people under investigation would be violated and that German courts should have jurisdiction over the overall issue.</p>
