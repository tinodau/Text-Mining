<p>Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak refused on Wednesday to intervene in the case of Azam Azam, an Israeli detained in Egypt and about to face trial for spying.</p>
<p>His case has added to the friction in Egyptian-Israeli ties at a time of high tensions following Israel's decision last week to build 6,500 new Jewish homes in Arab East Jerusalem. The Egyptian judge set Azam's trial date on the eve of a visit to Cairo by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Two of Azam's supporters accompanied Netanyahu to Cairo to plead the alleged spy's case. They said they visited Azam in prison on Wednesday and that he was being treated well.</p>
<p>As'ad As'ad, an advisor to Netanyahu and a former member of the Knesset who is also, like Azam, a member of Israel's Druze community, told reporters he discussed Azam's case with Mubarak's senior political adviser Osama el-Baz.</p>
<p>&quot;I found Azam in good shape. Egyptian prison authorities are treating him well. I have faith in the Egyptian justice and judiciary,&quot; As'ad said.</p>
<p>Asa'ad Arainy, municipal head of Azam's village, said he was confident Azam would be found innocent.</p>
<p>&quot;We told him the prime minister (Netanyahu) would discuss his case with President Mubarak,&quot; Arainy said. &quot;It was clear from the beginning that Azam would stand in front of the Egyptian judiciary. We're not against this and we are sure of his innocence. God willing this will be apparent to the judges.&quot;</p>
<p>At a joint conference with Netanyahu on Wednesday, Mubarak said the matter was out of his hands now that it had entered the judicial system.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said on Tuesday that Azam, a 35-year-old chief mechanic who was working at an Israeli-owed factory in Egypt, was innocent and that the case would be at the top of his agenda in talks with Mubarak.</p>
<p>Asked if he would agree to release the Israeli, Mubarak said: &quot;This case is before the court. We have no authority to exclude it from the court until it comes to an end. Before that we are not authorised, even our constitution doesn't give us the right to do anything or to release him.&quot;</p>
<p>Mubarak again said that Israeli publicity about Azam's case had damaged his chances and he compared it to an earlier incident in which the Egyptian authorities discreetly set free two suspected Israeli spies.</p>
<p>&quot;With the last one (Azam) there is definite proof according to the investigation done by the court. So that's why we could not release him,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The first two were released before going through the media. When the media declared about Azam, we were in a position not to leave him and he should defend himself. If he is innocent, he is going to be released without any problem,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Netanyahu stood to Mubarak's side but did not comment on the espionage case throughout the news conference.</p>
<p>But late on Tuesday he said: &quot;Azam Azam is at the top of my agenda... He has been jailed on a false charge of espionage, or assisting in espionage for Israel. He is not an agent of any of the Israeli intelligence organs -- I can guarantee that. He is not an indirect agent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He is nothing as far as Israeli intelligence is concerned. He is an Israeli citizen who has been falsely accused and we want him out,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the Egyptian judiciary set April 24 as the date for the start of Azam's trial. The case includes three other defendants -- an Egyptian man and two Israeli women who will be tried in absentia because they are not in Egypt.</p>
<p>Egypt became the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in 1979 but relations have cooled significantly since Netanyahu took office in June.</p>
