<p>The protracted truckers' strike in Spain took a more serious tone on Tuesday for two major German carmakers who announced a new round of production stoppages affecting thousands more workers.</p>
<p>Adam Opel AG, the German unit of U.S. carmaker General Motors Corp, said the Spanish strike has now affected about 20,000 members of its workforce and has so far prevented the production of some 11,000 vehicles.</p>
<p>Volkwagen AG, which is Europe's largest carmaker, said it would stop all production of its Polo model at the main Wolfsburg plant as of Tuesday night, preventing production of about 1,000 vehicles a day and affecting about 3,500 workers.</p>
<p>Spain's government has voiced concern that Spain is at risk of losing lucrative contracts due to the 13-day-old strike, which has prevented Opel and VW from receiving parts on the &quot;just-in-time&quot; system that requires prompt delivery shortly before the parts are put into the production process.</p>
<p>Carmakers have depleted their reserves, forcing them to shut down production at plants both in Germany and Spain.</p>
<p>But officials at both carmakers said the truckers' strike would not prompt them to review contracts with Spanish manufacturers or prompt a wave of doubts about existing parts delivery practices.</p>
<p>A General Motors official in Zurich said the U.S. carmaker, which produces the Opel and Vauxhall brands in Europe, would not contemplate changing its supplier contracts in Spain over a mere labour strike, noting labour troubles affect all countries of the European Union at one time or another.</p>
<p>&quot;There's always the possiblity of some work stoppage in any European country. There can be a strike anywhere. Those kinds of things are part and parcel of democratic processes,&quot; the GM official said from GM's European corporate headquarters.</p>
<p>The leader of VW's works council said in a radio interview on Tuesday that the &quot;just-in-time&quot; delivery system kept down the cost of new vehicles but that VW must also secure more contracts with local parts suppliers as a back-up system.</p>
<p>VW has not felt the brunt of the strike as heavily as Opel but said no end to the strike by the weekend would force it to stop production of the popular Golf model next week, which would affect a total of 20,000 VW workers in Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;The Golf vehicle production can be sustained through the end of the week,&quot; a VW spokesman said. &quot;But if the strike goes on into next week, we will certainly have worse troubles.&quot;</p>
<p>Though traffic was flowing freely in most parts of Spain by Tuesday, many plants, especially those of carmakers, were forced to cut back or halt production for lack of supplies.</p>
<p>And once the strike ends, truckers will need at least two to three days to reach Germany and carmakers another few days to restart operations and replenish supplies.</p>
<p>VW and Opel both said they did not expect any long-term impact on sales due to the strike, saying many of the cars that cannot be produced at the moment have already been sold and that customers may have to wait an extra one or two weeks.</p>
<p>After the strike in Spain ends, Opel said it planned to make up the lost production through additional shifts that are allowed through flexible work contracts.</p>
<p>Among individual plants, Opel said production at its Eisenach plant would suspend production of the Corsa vehicle for the night shift on Thursday and the first day shift, affecting 1,000 workers and production of 500 vehicles.</p>
<p>The carmaker will also suspend production at its component factory in Kaiserslautern on Friday, affecting about 4,000 workers. But Opel said it would go forward with a planned ceremony to mark the five-millionth engine to be produced at the factory scheduled for Thursday.</p>
