<p>Iran has arrested two Iraqis and two Iranians on charges of spying for Iraq, the official Iranian news agency IRNA said on Monday.</p>
<p>IRNA, quoting an Iranian official in Khuzestan oil province, said the four were trying to smuggle two members of the Iraq-based opposition group Mujahideen Khalq out of Iran. It said the arrests were made last week close to the Iraqi borders.</p>
<p>The Mujahideen Khalq has bases and military camps inside Iraq close to the borders with Iran.</p>
<p>IRNA said Iran also arrested members of six other Iraqi espionage networks. It did not say how many were involved but said the members were disguised as fishermen and traffickers in a bid to smuggle Mujahideen members in and out of Iran.</p>
<p>It said the arrests included three members of Iraq's intelligence service. &quot;They were on a mission to pass on Iran's classified military and economic information to the Iraqi intelligence,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Iran last year passed a law imposing the death sentence for espionage, singling out agents working for the United States and Israel.</p>
