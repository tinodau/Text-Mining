<headline>HSBC Capel sees VW shares near fair value.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-01-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>HSBC James Capel automotive industry analyst Bob Barber said on Friday he still rated shares in Volkswagen AG as a buy but believed the German carmaker's shares were moving toward fair value.</p>
<p>&quot;I still rate them as a buy but I am now advising that VW shares are moving toward fair value,&quot; Barber told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;VW was once rated one of the cheapest stocks in the sector,&quot; he said. But he added, &quot;The extent to which we have been pushing this stock has been moderating. It is not a sell but the sharp rise over the last two months makes it only moderately undervalued.&quot;</p>
<p>VW shares rose on Friday after the two carmakers said late on Thursday that they have settled their lawsuit over allegations that some former GM executives stole secret documents when they quit in March 1993 to join VW.</p>
<p>At 0910 GMT, VW was up 10.30 marks at 718.20 but off the session high at 724.50 marks, a new record high, in pre-bourse IBIS electronic dealings.</p>
<p>The settlement calls for VW to pay GM $100 million, buy some $1 billion worth of car parts over a seven-year period and retract statements made about the U.S. carmaker.</p>
<p>In return, GM has agreed to drop all civil litigation against VW, including its racketeering lawsuit filed in a Detroit federal court, which had threatened VW with a potential jury verdict payout in the billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Barber noted that VW shares &quot;had been racing up&quot; in anticipation of a potential settlement and realisation among investors that the chances were limited for VW to face a multi-billion dollar payout in a jury trial.</p>
<p>&quot;The fear were overdone,&quot; Barber said. &quot;The settlement is a fairly small figure when you look at the extent of the provision on its balance sheet. It should have no effect on VW at all.&quot;</p>
<p>Barber said VW has sorted out its problems in Spain with its SEAT unit and in the Czech Republic with its Skoda operations while also being poised for expansion in emerging markets such as South America and Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;People got a bit too wound up when they started talking about billions of dollars in jury rulings. It seemed unlikely. We can now look at the company clean again,&quot; Barber said.</p>
<p>The company has sorted out its problems in Spain and the Czech Republic and is seeking to expand in emerging markets such as South America and Asia.</p>
<p>&quot;I think looking back will see this as being a side issue to the improvement that has been taking place in VW's performance and its international operations,&quot; Barber said.</p>
