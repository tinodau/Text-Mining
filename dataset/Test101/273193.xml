<p>A federal judge on Monday denied bail for FBI agent Earl Pitts, who was charged last week with spying for the Soviet Union and Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;There is substantial reason to believe the defendant would want to flee if released,&quot; U.S. District Judge Rawles Jones said in denying a motion for bail by Pitts' attorney. The judge also said the release of the spy suspect would be a threat to national security.</p>
<p>Pitts, 43, appeared at the bail hearing in U.S. District Court, but did not speak.</p>
<p>FBI Agent David Lambert testified at the bail hearing that an escape plan was found in a computer in Pitts' office in 1995 when the FBI had him under surveillance.</p>
<p>But under questioning from Pitts' attorney, Nina Ginsberg, Lambert said Pitts turned down three offers from FBI agents posing as Russian spies to give him a false passport</p>
<p>Pitts was scheduled to be arraigned next week and is expected to plead not guilty. No trial date has been set.</p>
<p>The 13-year veteran of the FBI was arrested last Wednesday and charged with spying for the Soviet KGB and its Russian successor intelligence agency, the SVRR.</p>
<p>Pitts was indicted by a federal grand jury on 12 counts of spying for Russia and related crimes. He was charged with conspiracy to commit espionage, attempted espionage, communication of classified information without authority and conveyance without authority of U.S. property.</p>
<p>If convicted, Pitts faces a maximum penalty of life in prison on the espionage conspiracy and each of the attempted espionage charges, 10 to 15 years in prison on each of the other charges and a $250,000 fine on each count of the indictment.</p>
<p>The indictment alleged that Pitts began providing counter-intelligence information to the Soviet Union's intelligence service, the KGB, in 1987 while he was assigned to the FBI's New York office and that he continued his activities after he was assigned to the Washington FBI office in 1989.</p>
<p>It alleged that Pitts provided a wide range of sensitive, classified information to the KGB and its Russian successor organisation in return for substantial sums of money.</p>
<p>Pitts received from the KGB and its Russian successor, the SVRR, at least $224,000 through October, 1992, when he became &quot;dormant,&quot; prosecutors charged.</p>
<p>Earlier Harold Nicholson, a 16-year Central Intelligence Agency veteran, was accused of selling Moscow national security secrets for 29 months until his Nov. 16 arrest.</p>
<p>U.S. officials made clear following his arrest that Pitts' alleged sellout did far less damage to U.S. security than Nicholson's or that of Aldrich Ames, a 31-year CIA veteran who confessed in April 1994 to unmasking dozens of Soviet and other agents secretly in U.S. pay.</p>
