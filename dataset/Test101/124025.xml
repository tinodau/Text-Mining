<p>German shares closed largely flat on Thursday, subdued throughout the day by uncertainty surrounding the political situation in Russia.</p>
<p>The DAX index of 30 leading shares closed floor dealings almost unchanged at 2,716.26 points before news came through that Russian security chief Alexander Lebed had been sacked.</p>
<p>That initially pushed the IBIS DAX index of all-day computer trade off highs reached earlier in the day, but the index later recovered much of the ground lost to end 12.44 points, or 0.46 percent, higher at 2,717.50 points.</p>
<p>The most obvious beneficiary of the news was the dollar, whose gains in turn encouraged export-orientated German stocks, which react positively to mark weakness.</p>
<p>Despite Russian political instability, dealers said the psychological and technical level of 2,700 points for the DAX was unlikely to be breached this week.</p>
<p>&quot;The 2,700 level looks safe in any case,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>A gain of almost half a percent during early Wall Street was also supportive.</p>
<p>Dealers said software concern SAP AG had attracted interest during the day. SAP, which was rated top performing German company by a magazine on Wednesday, climbed 1.4 percent or 3.80 marks to end IBIS trade at 279 marks.</p>
<p>Car-maker Volkswagen stock ended IBIS trade down 2.75 marks at 584 after a U.S. judge on Wednesday denied a motion by VW seeking to block a lawsuit filed against it by U.S. automotive giant General Motors Co.</p>
<p>The GM lawsuit accuses VW and several of its top executives of stealing corporate secrets.</p>
<p>&quot;It has had more of an impact on sentiment than anything else. There has been some negativity surrounding VW shares anyway,&quot; one German automotive sector analyst said.</p>
<p>But he added that if the price fell any further, many investors would see it as an opportunity to buy back VW shares.</p>
<p>Daimler-Benz AG gained 1.82 marks to end computer trade at 88.95 after sources confirmed it was considering a plan for an internal &quot;merger&quot; of its Mercedes car- and truck-making unit within the Daimler parent company itself.</p>
<p>The move was seen as a part of attempt by Daimler chief Juergen Schrempp to make the group's individual operating units more responsive and focussed on quality.</p>
