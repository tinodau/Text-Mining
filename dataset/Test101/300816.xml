<p>What's good for General Motors Corp is now also certainly good for Germany.</p>
<p>The end of the four-year-old legal dispute between GM and Volkswagen AG on Thursday over allegations of industrial spying will go down as a victory for the U.S. giant, which got the German carmaker to meet all its demands for a deal.</p>
<p>VW agreed to pay GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG, $100 million and buy $1 billion worth of car parts over seven years, ridding itself of the headache over the March 1993 transfer of Jose Ignacio Lopez to VW and allegations he stole GM documents.  </p>
<p>The carmaker was also vindicated when VW retracted previous statements that GM sought to damage the reputation of Germany as an economic centre and fired the rest of the associates who followed Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, to VW in March 1993.</p>
<p>VW was under intense pressure to settle the dispute. A poll in December showed 43 percent of Germans were convinced VW's image had suffered as a result of the GM accusations.</p>
<p>The survey of 1,000 Germans in early December also showed that 35 percent feared VW sales would fall and a third expected VW, one of Germany's largest employeers with about 100,000 workers in the country, to lose jobs as a result.  </p>
<p>Opel officials had also long believed an out-of-court settlement of their Detroit lawsuit -- which charged top VW executives with racketeering laws first used to fight organized crime -- as a way to win without damaging the GM reputation.</p>
<p>Still, the deal will also allow VW to resume focusing on its business of making cars and a profit -- especially in GM's backyard in the United States.</p>
<p>While secret talks began earlier this week in Detroit to end the dispute, VW was saying publicly that it expected its sales in the United States to rise about 25 percent in 1997 after surging 18 percent to 135,907 vehicles in 1996.  </p>
<p>VW's U.S. sales in comparison to GM, which is the world's largest automaker, but VW is making inroads in the American market while maintaining its European market share at a time of production overcapacity and tough price competition.</p>
<p>West European car registration data for December shows VW with a 17.9 percent market share for the month and GM, which also includes its Vauxhall brand, second at 12.2 percent.</p>
<p>GM has sunk far since its 1960s glory days when it commanded half of the U.S. market. As recently as the 1980s, it held as much as 45 percent of the U.S. passenger car market.  </p>
<p>In 1996, GM's U.S. light vehicle sales fell 2.7 percent to 4.74 million units, causing its market share to drop to 31 percent from 32.6 percent in 1995 and 33.1 percent in 1994.</p>
<p>VW, meanwhile, has painted a bright outlook, saying worldwide deliveries in 1996 rose by some 400,000 to almost four million vehicles and that profits would top 1995 levels.</p>
<p>It's a far cry from the situation when VW posted a billion mark loss in 1993 tied to restructuring costs, and Lopez was called on to make VW's costly production and purchasing operations competitive again.</p>
<p>Critics will certainly argue that GM should get the credit for the turnaround since German prosecutors say Lopez used GM data in presentations to VW managers. But the impact of Lopez's work has long been felt at GM, which has complained that its 20 percent cost advantage in Europe over VW has been blunted.</p>
<p>And VW is not yet in the clear since German prosecutors have filed criminal charges against Lopez and three others. A trial is expected as soon as later this year.</p>
<p>A U.S. grand jury is also investigating Lopez, which could lead to fresh revelations about VW's role in the saga despite German prosecutors saying they found no sufficient evidence of a conspiracy between Lopez and top VW executives.</p>
