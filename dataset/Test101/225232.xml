<headline>German shares storm ahead to new record highs.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-11-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Germany's DAX index charged upwards on Friday to end floor trade at a new all-time high, with the market spurred on by ever-stronger German government bonds and the continued firmness of the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything looks perfect, both the bond and the dollar. We could keep climbing,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The DAX index of Germany's top 30 stocks closed bourse dealings at 2,845.52 points, up 28.03 points, or 0.99 percent. Shares in the banking and chemical sectors led the assault.</p>
<p>Later the IBIS DAX, which measures all-day computer trade in the DAX index, powered ahead even further to touch 2,854.59 points, before closing at 2,848.84 points, up 19.16 points, or 0.68 percent.</p>
<p>The DAX has gained three percent in the last week alone, six percent in the last month, surprising commentators with the speed of the recent rally.</p>
<p>Analysts said the climb could continue next week and until the year-end, when they see the DAX reaching the crucial 2,900 point level, although they said the market could pause briefly to catch its breath before charging on again.</p>
<p>German government bonds have also been powering ahead, the Bund future reaching an all-time high of 102.59.</p>
<p>Chemical stocks were particularly favoured in Friday's rally, heavily-weighted on the DAX, and as major exporters benefitting in particular from the firmer dollar.</p>
<p>Shares in Bayer AG, BASF AG and Hoechst AG were all strongly ahead in the sector, while shares in banks were also firmer with Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank leading the way.</p>
<p>Dealers said shares in Europe's largest car company Volkswagen were at the centre of attention, after the firm accepted the resignation of production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who is at the centre of a three year battle between VW and U.S. giant General Motors.</p>
<p>Shares in VW slipped after the news to a day's low of 610.50 marks and then recovered to end bourse dealings up 3.50 marks at 616.50 marks.</p>
<p>Dealers said they were not sure whether the Lopez resignation would mean the end of the legal battle, which was keeping the lid on any more significant recovery in the share price.</p>
