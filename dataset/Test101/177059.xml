<p>The Frankfurt state prosecutors' office on Friday declined to confirm a report it planned to charge the production chief of German carmaker Volkswagen AG with alleged industrial espionage.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the office said a decision on whether to charge Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua would be taken by the end of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not commenting on whether a decision has already been taken to bring charges or to terminate proceedings,&quot; spokeswoman Hildegard said.</p>
<p>She would not discuss a report in the Munich-based Sueddeutsche Zeitung that said VW's lawyers expected Lopez and three others to face charges for allegedly taking secret information with them when they left VW rival Opel in 1993.</p>
<p>The three other executives -- identified as Jose Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez and Rosario Piazza -- left Opel, a unit of General Motors Corp, when Lopez defected to the German carmaker and joined its management board.</p>
<p>VW, which has consistently denied the allegations, declined comment on the report but said Lopez would stay with the company even if he were to face criminal charges.</p>
<p>Lopez, a Basque, has been renowned for his ability to streamline production and cut costs, setting innovative working practices at Europe's largest carmaker that have helped VW to return to profitability.</p>
<p>Volkswagen referred calls to its Frankfurt lawyer, who was not available for comment.</p>
<p>Before a decision was made public, the parties involved would have to be informed by the Darmstadt public prosecutors' office near Frankfurt which is leading the probe, Becker-Toussaint said.</p>
<p>In a bitter three-year legal dispute, GM and its German subsidiary Opel have alleged that Lopez and seven other former GM managers took secrets on purchasing and production plans when they moved to VW.</p>
<p>GM and Opel have also filed a lawsuit in the U.S. against VW and its top executives, including Lopez and VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech, due to frustration at the pace of the German criminal investigation.</p>
<p>GM first filed a legal complaint against Lopez a month after his defection and against another former GM manager, but the company later suspended the action.</p>
