<p>Also in July, U.S. prosecutors in Detroit begin probe against Lopez and his colleagues. Speaking in an interview with Germany's Stern magazine, VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech describes the Lopez affair as &quot;international economic war&quot; against his company.</p>

<p>December 9 - VW's Piech issues statement saying he has &quot;deepest regrets&quot; for damages done to both VW and GM by the Lopez affair, notes VW was prepared to buy parts from GM instead of paying for damages. GM calls Piech statement insufficient.</p>
