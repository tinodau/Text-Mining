<p>A veteran CIA officer has been arrested on charges of passing classified information to Moscow for the past two years, allegedly motivated by cash, U.S. officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>The suspect, whose name was under seal until an initial court appearance on Monday morning, was arrested by FBI agents on Saturday afternoon at Dulles Airport outside Washington as he was preparing to board a flight, an FBI spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman, Susan Lloyd of the FBI's Washington field office, declined to specify the suspect's destination when arrested, but said he apparently had been leaving on a long-planned trip and not attempting to flee.</p>
<p>The suspect was to appear before federal magistrate Thomas Rawles Jones of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia at 11 a.m. (1600 GMT) in Alexandria, law enforcement officials said.</p>
<p>The CIA and the FBI have been hunting for a second possible Moscow spy inside the CIA since the Feb. 21, 1994, arrest of Aldrich Ames, who is serving a life prison term for selling some of the most sensitive U.S. spy secrets to Moscow over a 10-year period.</p>
<p>John Deutch, the director of central intelligence, and Louis Freeh, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, will give details of the case at 1 p.m. EST (1800 GMT) at FBI headquarters, FBI spokesman Bill Carter said.</p>
<p>The person arrested in the new case appeared to have been spying for Moscow for about two years, a U.S. official said. He said the damage done appeared to be nowhere &quot;near the magnitude&quot; caused by Ames, who unmasked about three dozen agents and perhaps hundreds of operations.</p>
<p>&quot;Any time you have a spy in your midst, it's bad news,&quot; the official said. &quot;The good news is that he was caught, and he was caught quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>Justice Department officials said the suspect was a 16-year veteran of the CIA whose job included training spy agency employees. The motive for the alleged espionage was money, one official said.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Chesnut, who is prosecuting the case, said the initial court hearing would determine whether the suspect had a lawyer, inform him of his rights and go over the nature of the charges and maximum penalties.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Helen Fahey was to hold a news conference at 11:45 a.m. EST (1645 GMT) at her office next to the court to make public the complaint in the case and a lengthy FBI affidavit, Chesnut said.</p>
<p>The New York Times said on Monday that the officer had served overseas and had access to secret material on a wide range of issues involving Russia and the former Soviet Union's Cold War satellite states.</p>
<p>The arrest of Ames, a 31-year career officer, set in motion changes in the U.S. intelligence community that have yet to run their course.</p>
<p>James Woolsey resigned as CIA director in December 1994 after being sharply criticised in Congress for his handling of failings that let Ames spy for Moscow under the CIA's nose for nearly a decade.</p>
