<p>On a blustery Friday night in March 10 years ago 191 men, women and children were drowned when the roll-on-roll-off ferry Herald of Free Enterprise capsized as it left the Belgian port of Zeebrugge on the way to Dover.</p>
<p>&quot;The memory is still clear,&quot; Harbour Master Ignace Vergult, who was not on duty on the night of March 6, 1987 but who was called in, told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope that it will never, ever, happen again. Ferry safety has improved since then, but whether it has improved enough is another question,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Survivors and the relatives of the dead will hold memorial services in Dover and Zeebrugge on Sunday, after which the British Herald Families Association will be quietly be wound up.</p>
<p>&quot;The pain has been too much. They feel they have done all they can,&quot; Mark Watts, British Labour Member of the European Parliament for East Kent, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>&quot;As politicians we have a responsibility to maintain the momentum,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Watts agrees with Vergult that passenger ferry safety has improved a bit since the Herald went down. But he argues strongly that there is far, far more still to be done.</p>
<p>&quot;If an aircraft had a design fault the fleet would be grounded. But ferries are allowed to sail with fundamental design flaws,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Herald rolled over and sank in shallow water because it had become unstable due to taking on water through leaving port with the bow doors open.</p>
<p>Immediately after a number of changes were made to enhance ferry safety. Notable among these were the installation of inner doors to supplement the main outer doors, and a signalling system to prevent the ferry leaving dock with the outer doors open.</p>
<p>But ferry companies resisted other recommendations such as installing water-tight bulkheads on car decks and making a full passenger list -- moves they still argue against.</p>
<p>The business of finding and identifying the dead from the Herald was made considerably harder by the fact that no one knew how many people were on board.</p>
<p>It was not until the ferry Estonia sank during a storm in the Baltic, killing most of the 867 passengers and crew in September 1994 that the issue gained new momentum.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing really happened after the Herald sank. A few minor technical changes were made but nothing that addressed the fundamental issues,&quot; Watts said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was not until the Estonia went down that things started to happen again.</p>
<p>&quot;Since the Estonia sank we have had the Stockholm agreement on maritime safety, but even that does not go far enough because it does not insist on the fundamental design changes that were proposed after the Herald sank,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Watts said one of the main problems was the reluctance of the ferry operators -- particularly those on the cross-channel run where they are facing tough competition from each other and the Channel Tunnel -- to incur extra costs. There was also, he said, the problem that there is no single organisation either competent or capable of policing the seas.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a whole myriad of organisations apparently enforcing the law. We feel there should be one single body,&quot; Watts said, adding that although the International Maritime Organisation did have powers it could only act by unanimity.</p>
<p>&quot;People's lives are being put at risk. Is it going to take another Herald or Estonia before we take the whole issue seriously?&quot; he said.</p>
