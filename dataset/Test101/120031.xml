<p>A delegation of the London club creditors is due to begin &quot;technical&quot; talks on Yugoslavia's commercial debt in Belgrade on October 17, the daily Nasa Borba reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not a senior delegation since the forthcoming talks are purely of a technical nature,&quot; John Eisenhammer of Lowe Bell Financial, Yugoslavia's public relations adviser, was quoted by Nasa Borba as saying.</p>
<p>Eisenhammer said the two delegations would discuss documents submitted by the Yugoslav government to the London Club, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank on the economic situation and economic forecasts.</p>
<p>No-one from the Yugoslav delegation was immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Creditors last met Yugoslav officials in London in July to discuss rescheduling the $2 billion commercial debt inherited by rump Yugoslavia after the violent breakup of the former federation in 1991.</p>
<p>Eisenhammer said &quot;real&quot; talks with the London club on how to reschedule Yugoslavia's commercial debt could be expected in December, as well as preliminary talks with the World bank, while talks with the IMF were still uncertain.</p>
<p>&quot;World Bank experts can be expected in Belgrade at the end of the year. As for the IMF, there is no timing,&quot; he said. -- Amra Kevic, Belgrade newsroom +381 11 2224305</p>
