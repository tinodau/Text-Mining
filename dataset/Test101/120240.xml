<p>A Taiwan businessman turned himself in to local authorities, claiming he had collected state secrets for the island's rival, China, over the past two years, state media said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The businessman, surnamed Chang, told the Bureau of Investigation that he had helped spies from mainland China to collect the island's national defence and foreign policy secrets.</p>
<p>In return, Beijing helped Chang with his investment projects on the mainland, the reports said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first case this year,&quot; a bureau official said on state television. &quot;Related authorities are closely monitoring similar cases.&quot;</p>
<p>The bureau declined to give further details.</p>
<p>The businessman was under investigation for espionage, state media said.</p>
<p>China has viewed Taiwan as a renegade province since a civil war separated them in 1949. Taiwan has banned all direct official contact with communist China.</p>
<p>All investment projects must be routed through a third territory, usually Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Despite the ban, indirect commerce has flourished since the late 1980s when political tensions started to thaw. Some 30,000 Taiwan firms have poured more than US$20 billion into China.</p>
