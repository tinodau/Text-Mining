<p>Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp are near a settlement in their legal battle over whether Jose Ignacio Lopez stole GM secrets when he defected to VW in 1993, the news weekly Der Spiegel said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The executive resigned as VW's production chief on Friday.</p>
<p>VW could face penalties totalling billions of dollars after a U.S. court decided earlier this week the GM complaint could proceed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO).</p>
<p>In an advance release from Monday's edition, Spiegel said VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen and Lower Saxony state premier Gerhard Schroeder had drawn up a proposed out-of-court settlement with GM executive committee chairman John Smale. Lower Saxony is VW's largest shareholder.</p>
<p>Asked in an interview with the Sueddeutsche Zeitung about the chances for a settlement, Liesen said: &quot;Time will tell.&quot;</p>
<p>Liesen said prosecution under RICO required proof of a conspiracy, a story he said not even the GM side could believe.</p>
<p>Spiegel said now that Lopez had left VW, fulfilling the first of GM's conditions, Smale had signalled GM might soften its other demands for an apology and a financial settlement.</p>
<p>The proposed deal included a commitment by VW to buy GM parts, but Smale's plan had opponents within GM who were insisting the case go to court, the magazine said.</p>
<p>Spiegel said Lopez would receive a four million mark settlement for leaving VW, the value of his contract up to its expiry in 1998. Bild newspaper reported the value of the settlement was 11 million marks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Focus magazine said GM's German subsidiary Adam Opel AG was among the hardline factions insisting on the fulfilment of the remaining conditions.</p>
<p>A VW spokesman said the company would have no comment on the reports.</p>
