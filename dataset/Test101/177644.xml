<title>GERMANY: VW lawyers expect Lopez charges in November.</title>
<headline>VW lawyers expect Lopez charges in November.</headline>

<p>A lawyer representing Volkswagen AG executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua said Friday he expected German prosecutors to file industrial spying charges against the former General Mortors Corp. executive by the end of the month.</p>
<p>The lawyer, Juergen Taschke, said in a statement issued by his Frankfurt office that he &quot;still expected in November&quot; charges to be filed against Lopez.</p>
<p>Taschke issued the statement after he told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper that he expected Lopez and three other VW workers to face charges for allegedly taking secret data with them when they left GM in 1993.</p>
<p>The three other executives -- identified as Jose Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez and Rosario Piazza -- left GM subsidiary Opel when Lopez defected to Volkswagen and joined its management board.</p>
<p>In a bitter three-year legal dispute, GM and Opel have alleged that Lopez and seven other former GM managers stole secrets on purchasing and production plans when they moved to Volkswagen.</p>
<p>VW, which has consistently denied the allegations, declined to comment on the report but said Lopez would stay with the company even if he were to face criminal charges.</p>
<p>Lopez, a Basque, has been renowned for his ability to streamline production and cut costs, setting about innovative work practices at VW, Europe's largest carmaker, that have helped it to return to profitability.</p>
<p>Volkswagen also referred calls to its Frankfurt lawyer, who was not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt state prosecutors' office declined to confirm the newspaper report but a spokeswoman said a decision on whether to charge Lopez would be made by the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not commenting on whether a decision has already been taken to bring charges or to terminate proceedings,&quot; Hildegard Becker-Toussaint, the office's spokeswoman, said in response to a query.</p>
<p>Before a decision was made public, the parties involved would have to be informed by the Darmstadt public prosecutors' office, which is leading the probe, she added.</p>
<p>VW sources said the Wolfsburg-based company, the largest carmaker in Europe, was preparing itself for charges to be filed against Lopez and the other executives, who were top and middle-level managers who reported to him.</p>
<p>GM and Opel have also filed a lawsuit in Detroit against VW and its top executives, including Lopez and VW Management Board Chairman Ferdinand Piech, due to frustration at the pace of the German criminal investigation.</p>
<p>GM first filed a legal complaint against Lopez and another former GM manager a month after Lopez's defection, but the company later suspended that action.</p>
