<p>Volkswagen AG, cornered by adverse court rulings in its three-year legal fight with General Motors, on Friday sacrificed its production chief in an apparent bid to end the dispute.</p>
<p>Volkswagen's supervisory board accepted a request by Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the cost-cutting crusader at the centre of industrial spying allegations, to resign immediately.</p>
<p>But Europe's largest carmaker continued to maintain Lopez was innocent of allegation he stole industrial secrets from his former employer General Motors Corp or its German subsidiary Adam Opel AG.</p>
<p>While both sides kept up a hard public face, speculation was widespread they planned talks towards an out-of-court settlement in the dispute, which might otherwise cost VW billions of dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;Investigations by independent auditors have given no indications that Opel secrets were passed on to VW, and no indications that Lopez colluded with VW employees to transfer secrets,&quot; VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;No one can claim VW has acted improperly,&quot; Liesen said.</p>
<p>Opel said Lopez's resignation alone was not adequate compensation for the damages it alleges the manager inflicted.</p>
<p>&quot;The resignation of Lopez is three years overdue and cannot compensate our company for the losses incurred to date,&quot; Opel said in a statement. There remained a need to establish personal responsibility in the case and to assess the damage done to date, it added.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone who is interested in facts, the truth and in ensuring the good name of Volkswagen, will welcome legal procedures to clarify the situation,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech said VW and GM had discussed a settlement in three rounds of talks without conditions, and that VW would not bend to such conditions now.</p>
<p>But GM said late in the day it would not talk further with VW unless VW met certain conditions.</p>
<p>Piech said he hoped Lopez would continue to work for VW as a consultant. Liesen said Lopez's contract would have expired in March 1998, and that VW would meet its commitments to Lopez under the contract. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Shares in VW reached a day's high of 619.70 marks in computer trade after the news of Lopez's resignation, which traders see as helping take some of the heat off VW in the dispute, but fell back to trade up 4.75 marks at 618.75 marks in later computer trade.</p>
<p>VW has consistently denied accusations that Lopez and three other former GM executives now at VW stole boxes of secret documents and computer disks on purchasing and car production plans when they defected to VW in early 1993.</p>
<p>Lawyers representing Lopez said he had asked to leave VW to concentrate on his defence and to fulfil a long-standing dream to set up a consultancy firm for industrial purchasing.</p>
<p>Liesen said Lopez would not have been able to prepare his defence with sufficient intensity if he had stayed on.</p>
<p>Pressure on VW to reach an out-of-court settlement rose sharply on Tuesday when a U.S. district judge in Detroit, GM's home town, ruled GM could pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and other VW executives, including VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech.</p>
<p>Allowing the legal action to proceed under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO), which has been widely used to prosecute the mafia, trebles the amount of compensation VW would have to pay if found guilty. Industry sources say VW may have to pay billions of dollars.</p>
<p>In a statement on Friday, the supervisory board expressly thanked Lopez for his &quot;excellent&quot; work.</p>
<p>&quot;The board said Mr Lopez as management board member applied himself for Volkswagen in an excellent way and achieved big successes through his high qualification as an engineer and his personal charisma,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Lopez, a Basque renowned for his ability to streamline production and cut carmaking costs, established innovative working practices at VW that helped return it to profitability.</p>
<p>But media reports have speculated that Piech's own future may also be in doubt if the court action goes ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;At the moment there is nothing to suggest that his (Piech's) contract will not be extended,&quot; Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote in a commentary on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;But who is to say what will happen if Piech has to face a U.S. court?&quot;</p>
<p>Sources close to GM said they did not expect Piech to back down in any out-of-court settlement but expected some movement from VW's supervisory board.</p>
