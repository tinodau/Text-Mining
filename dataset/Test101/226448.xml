<headline>Lopez resignation alone not enough - Opel sources.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-11-29</dateline>

<p>The resignation of Volkswagen production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua on its own would not be enough of a basis for a settlement with General Motors in the current legal dispute, Opel sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Lopez stepping down would only be a symbolic move, a long-overdue decision which will have come too late,&quot; the Opel sources said.</p>
<p>Talks to settle the three-year legal dispute between the two carmakers over alleged industrial espionage by Lopez and other senior VW employees were not taking place at the moment, the sources told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Opel, GM's German unit, said that the time for which Lopez had been employed by Volkswagen would stand in direct relation to the amount of damages GM/Opel would seek from its rival, sources at Opel headquarters in Ruesselsheim said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday Opel said that it was looking for a public apology and damages, as well as Lopez's resignation. Opel said that &quot;substantial reparation for damages&quot; was the most important condition for a settlement. The company has not put a figure on the amount of damages it is seeking.</p>
<p>GM/Opel has accused Lopez and other senior managers now with Volkswagen of taking strategically-important company information with them when they left their positions at Opel to move to VW.</p>
<p>Volkswagen some time ago scheduled a news conference for 1530 GMT on Friday on the exhibition EXPO 2000, which now looks set to be inundated by media seeking news about Lopez's future.</p>
<p>VW said earlier that its supervisory board would make a statement on Friday if it reaches a decision at its meeting.</p>
<p>Media reports have said that Lopez is likely to offer his resignation at the meeting.</p>
