<p>Thai stocks, which have been crawling at eight-year lows in past weeks, changed course on Monday and leapt by more than four percent on a technical rebound aided by foreign fund buying, brokers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not surprising that after so many dreadful days of falls the market should rise. It's basically a technical rebound,&quot; said Richard Henderson, head of research at Krung Thai Thanakit Plc.</p>
<p>The index finished up 21.15 points to 501.40 at the lunch break.</p>
<p>&quot;I think today's gains represent a reallocation of funds to Thailand by investors with a long term, say two year, view of the market,&quot; said a trader at a Thai Military Bank affiliated brokerage.</p>
<p>Other analysts cautioned that the rebound should not be viewed as the start of a pick up in battered Thai stock prices.</p>
<p>More obstacles hung over the market, including political infighting in the ruling six-party coalition, and the side-effects of the country's worst economic slump in more than a decade.</p>
<p>A technical analyst at the International Finance Institute in Bangkok said the stock index rebound over tough resistance at the 488-level was limited.</p>
<p>&quot;The rebound did not reach all lines. Only the main banks are really sought after so far. The move must extend to a majority of large caps today or it will mean that it will stop sooner than expected,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The unexpected surge followed the government's appointment of low-profile banker Thanong Bidaya on Friday to take charge of economic policy. His respected successor Amnuay Viravan had quit following intra-coalition government feuds.</p>
<p>But Thanong's naming had little to do with the market's upward burst, brokers said. &quot;I think the market is relatively neutral towards Thanong,&quot; said a trader at a broker affiliated to Thai Farmers bank.</p>
<p>Thanong has said little about what he plans to do to lift Thailand from the economic crisis that has hit the troubled finance sector now overexposed to cash-strapped property firms.</p>
<p>The new minister has pledged to sustain Amnuay's financial disciplines. Amnuay had ordered steep budget cuts and state-managed rescue packages for the ailing property and finance sectors to bail out the economy.</p>
<p>On Monday, government officials said the embattled government planned to issue decrees outlining urgent measures to revamp the troubled finance and property sectors.</p>
<p>The decrees would have contained details with guidelines for merging finance firms hit by liquidity crunches, outlining government roles in refinancing property loans extended by financial institutions and possibly measures to stamp out baht speculation.</p>
<p>But a government minister said later on Monday that the Thai cabinet would delay the issue of the decrees because of some disagreement within government leaders on the exact nature of the planned measures.</p>
