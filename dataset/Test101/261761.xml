<p>Germany's opposition Social Democrats on Tuesday pressed the government to toughen protection against industrial espionage, claiming trade thefts cost German companies as much as 20 billions marks ($13 billion) last year.</p>
<p>Long-term snooping by corporate competitors and foreign intelligence services could also undermine German jobs and the country's economic strength, the SPD said at a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;It can be very damaging for firms if they face Eastern European competitors who can get stolen technology and have the advantage of low labour costs,&quot; said Ernst Schwanhold, spokesman for the SPD fraction in the Bundestag.</p>
<p>&quot;It is cheaper to steal than to innovate,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The recent case between General Motors Corp. and Volkswagen AG offers only one high-profile example damages that may result from trade theft, Schwanhold said.</p>
<p>In that case, Jose Ignacio Lopez, former purchasing chief at GM's Adam Opel unit, is accused in American and German courts of taking production secrets to Volkswagen in 1993. He has resigned from VW, but the German car maker could face billions of dollars in damage payments, if found guilty.</p>
<p>About a thousand cases of espionage against German firms go unnoticed or unreported each year, according to the main German police union, which joined the SPD's call for stiffer fines and jail terms trade thefts.</p>
<p>Companies often don't want thefts to generate negative publicity, or judge the penalties too small to warrant the effort, said union chief Hermann Lutz.</p>
<p>Most involve German companies spying on their German competitors, but a growing number involve intelligence services from Eastern European countries trying to help firms in their countries compete, Lutz added.</p>
<p>The SPD would not want to use Germany's secret service for industrial espionage, although the U.S. and Russia, like France, were widely believed to do so, he and Lutz said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Kohl's Christian Democrat party said economic spying would likely become a topic of discussion in parliament in the coming weeks.</p>
