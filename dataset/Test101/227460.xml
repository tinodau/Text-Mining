<p>Sources at Adam Opel AG, German unit of General Motors Corp, denied on Sunday it was close to an out-of-court settlement with Volkswagen AG over alleged industrial espionage by departing VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no settlement negotiations,&quot; said one Opel source, denying a report in news weekly Der Spiegel that a settlement had already been drawn up by top managers from the two sides and was just awaiting GM approval.</p>
<p>GM maintains that Lopez, who resigned on Friday from VW, stole GM secrets when he defected to VW in 1993. A VW plant in Brazil, whose construction Lopez supervised, is said to draw strongly on earlier Opel plans for a &quot;Plant X&quot;.</p>
<p>VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech said on Friday the two sides had met three times to discuss a settlement.</p>
<p>The Opel sources, who declined to be named, said the fact that Piech suggested Lopez could continue to work as a consultant for VW could delay the settlement VW seeks.</p>
<p>VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen on Friday praised Lopez's performance and said VW would meet its obligations under his contract, which did not expire until March 1998.</p>
<p>Media reports said Lopez would receive a payoff of four million to 11 million marks.</p>
<p>VW could face penalties totalling billions of dollars in a suit brought by GM in the United States. A Detroit court decided last week GM could pursue its complaint under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO).</p>
<p>A &quot;status conference&quot; in the case is scheduled for Tuesday, where lawyers for the two sides will outline their plans for further proceedings.</p>
<p>The Opel source said the judge was likely to ask at that session about the prospects for an out-of-court settlement. The GM lawyers are most likely to repeat their standing position that there are no ongoing settlement negotiations.</p>
<p>GM has publicly set three conditions for a settlement: Lopez's departure from VW, a public apology, and a financial settlement.</p>
<p>Opel believes Lopez's resignation is a diversionary manoeuvre that does not satisfy the first of GM's conditions for a settlement.</p>
<p>Spiegel said Liesen and Lower Saxony state premier Gerhard Schroeder had drawn up a proposed out-of-court settlement with GM executive committee chairman John Smale. Lower Saxony is VW's largest shareholder.</p>
<p>Lopez was reported to be at home in Spain, resting and concentrating on his defence in the U.S. case.</p>
<p>VW officials had no comment on the Lopez affair on Sunday. -- Bonn newsroom, 49 228 26097150</p>
