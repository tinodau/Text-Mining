<p>Ecuadorean analysts said at a conference on Wednesday they were waiting for the government's announcement of the country's new economic policies expected next week.</p>
<p>&quot;The president will announce the (economic) strategy and measures next week,&quot; Central Bank of Ecuador technical official Mauricio Pareja told Reuters.</p>
<p>Ecuadorean President Fabian Alarcon was appointed interim president until August 1998 by Congress in February, after former President Abdala Bucaram was deposed.</p>
<p>Central bank officials in London ahead of the economic policy announcement outlined the country's current economic programme which is expected to be kept in place.</p>
<p>Central Bank of Ecuador technical director Mauricio Valencia said the economic programme provided a basis for a stand-by agreement with the International Monetary Fund and a subsequent Paris Club restructuring.</p>
<p>The team will meet with the Paris Club on Thursday, ahead of further investor presentations in Madrid and Amsterdam. The team has also visited New York.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a necessity for us to normalise our relations with the Paris Club members,&quot; Pareja said.</p>
<p>He said the economic programme focused on reducing the fiscal deficit, &quot;the main problem&quot; in Ecuador.</p>
<p>A key objective was for a budget deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP in 1997 and 1.3 percent in 1998, he said.</p>
<p>Pareja said attainable measures to achieve a deficit reduction were spending cuts, which included the &quot;elimination of positions&quot;.</p>
<p>There were also revenue enhancement schemes which included the reimbursement of EMELEC debt, increased customs revenues, increased import tariffs and an increase in electricity rates.</p>
<p>But when asked whether Ecuador planned to increase taxes to raise revenues Pareja said that would not be immediately possible.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no room to increase taxes now, the political constraint is very strong,&quot; he said. &quot;We could introduce tax reforms by the year-end but for now it is difficult.&quot;</p>
<p>He said Value Added Tax could be introduced by the end of the year.</p>
