<p>Carmakers Volkswagen AG of Germany and U.S.-based General Motors Corp said on Thursday they had reached a settlement resolving a dispute stemming from alleged industrial espionage by former executive Jose Ignacio Lopez.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, they said they had &quot;reached a settlement agreement on all civil disputes relating to the Lopez matter between the companies in Germany and the United States.&quot;</p>
<p>The settlement includes an arrangement under which VW would pay General Motors $100 million. VW has also committed itself to enter into supply contracts to buy GM parts worth $1 billion over a period of seven years.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, GM and its German subsidiary Adam Opel AG and Volkswagen will drop all civil litigation against each other or against individuals. This includes a civil action brought against VW in the Detroit Federal Court in March 1996.</p>
<p>The statement said the companies expressed satisfaction that they were able to settle the disputeand create an appropriate environment to let them look forward to &quot;a future unencumbered by the legacy of this matter.&quot;</p>
<p>In a separate letter, VW confirmed to GM that four former GM managers, including Lopez, who moved to VW had all either resigned, or were due to take administrative leave.</p>
<p>The letter was part of the agreement resolving the bitter dispute over the allegations that the executives took industrial secrets with them when they moved to VW in 1993.</p>
<p>VW has already accepted the resignation of executives Lopez and Jose Manuel Gutierrez. Two more executives, Rosaria Alvarez and Jorge Piazza, will resign, or take administrative leave by the end of January, VW said.</p>
<p>In the letter, VW also noted that the four managers were still the subject of a suit brought by German prosecutors in Darmstadt alleging illegal activities.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, Volkswagen acknowledges the possibility that illegal activities by the individuals may have occurred. These allegations remain to be proven or disproven,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>For its part, GM said in a letter to VW that it would continue to cooperate fully with the public prosecutors.</p>
<p>&quot;General Motors and Opel necessarily will abide by and respect the judgments of the prosecutors and the outcome of their investigations and proceedings,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>VW spokesman Klaus Kocks told Reuters in response to an inquiry that the company had set aside reserves to cover the payment of $100 million to GM as part of the out-of-court settlement.</p>
