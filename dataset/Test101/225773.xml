<title>GERMANY: Volkswagen workers unconcerned by Lopez fate.</title>
<headline>Volkswagen workers unconcerned by Lopez fate.</headline>
<dateline>WOLFSBURG, Germany 1996-11-29</dateline>

<p>Workers at Volkswagen AG's plant showed no concern on Friday at the fate of production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who stepped down to concentrate on his defence in a U.S. lawsuit brought by his former employer General Motors.</p>
<p>&quot;VW could not hold onto Lopez any longer,&quot; said one employee, asked outside the plant to comment on Lopez's resignation.</p>
<p>&quot;He was good for VW from an economic point of view but the productivity gains he achieved were won on the backs of the workers.</p>
<p>&quot;German authorities were too sluggish in dealing with the whole affair. U.S. authorities were quicker, and the problem for our plant is that we will lose our market in the U.S. if this goes on.&quot;</p>
<p>GM and its German unit Adam Opel AG allege that Lopez and three other former GM executives now at VW stole secret documents and computer disks when they defected to VW in 1993.</p>
<p>A U.S. district judge in Detroit recently ruled GM could pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and other VW executives, including chief executive Ferdinand Piech.</p>
<p>VW may have to pay billions of dollars in the case.</p>
<p>Lopez, renowned as a cost-cutter, had won few friends among the workers. &quot;I think it is good he left,&quot; said another worker, who also asked not to be identified. &quot;He should have left three years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think he is going to be the only one to go,&quot; the second worker added, voicing a widespread belief that the three colleagues who came with Lopez from GM would also be under pressure to leave VW.</p>
<p>A third employee said, &quot;He did a lot of good for the company, but we don't know what went on behind the scenes.&quot;</p>
