<p>Adam Opel AG, declaring victory in its row over charges of industrial spying with Volkswagen AG, said on Friday it never wanted to win damages of a size that would have crippled the German carmaker.</p>
<p>Opel, the German unit of General Motors Corp, said the deal reached on Thursday over charges that cost-cutting production guru Jose Ignacio Lopez stole GM data when he joined VW in 1993, freed VW from the risk of a U.S. jury ruling in the billions of dollars.</p>
<p>The deal was greeted enthusiastically by the markets and  VW shares rose as much as two percent before paring gains on profit-taking. VW shares have risen about 10 percent this week on speculation that a deal would soon rid the carmaker of its legal troubles.</p>
<p>VW shares reached a new record high at 724.50 marks before ending bourse trade up 21.50 marks at 712 marks. In post-bourse IBIS electronic trade, they slipped to 695 marks.</p>
<p>VW agreed to pay GM $100 million, buy $1 billion worth of GM parts over the next seven years and retract statements that included charges GM may have tampered with evidence before it was collected by German prosecutors.</p>
<p>In return, GM agreed to drop its U.S. lawsuit in a Detroit federal court based on racketeering laws that call for any damages awarded by a jury to be automatically tripled.</p>
<p>&quot;Our objectives were never to receive damages which could fully compensate for what was done because it would have been a catastrophe for VW and would have then undercut our role in the world,&quot; Opel chief executive David Herman told a news briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;We would have never done it. We never wanted to do it. Our actions with the U.S. lawsuit were aimed at getting VW to negotiate,&quot; he said at Opel's headquarters near Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Volkswagen also said on Friday it did not expect a serious impact on its profit due to the settlement, with analysts noting the carmaker has more than 17 billion marks ($10.8 billion) in reserves.</p>
<p>&quot;The compromise is a little cloud in an otherwise bright sky,&quot; VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said on Friday.</p>
<p>The two carmakers on Thursday ended the fight after several days of intensive talks between their lawyers in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>Herman said VW initiated the new round in early January after German prosecutors filed charges against Lopez, who also faces a probe by U.S. prosecutors in Detroit. Three previous rounds of talks during the last four years had failed.</p>
<p>&quot;After the indictment against Lopez, the situation became more or less clear. The moment was right,&quot; said Herman, noting that GM had spent about 10 million marks on legal fees.</p>
<p>GM sued VW in Detroit last year, alleging that Lopez and his followers stole secret data on GM's future European product plans, parts prices and manufacturing techniques that helped VW slash more than a billion marks in costs.</p>
<p>GM also had accused VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech and other top VW executives of conspiring with Lopez, a fiery 55-year-old Spaniard, to plot an elaborate scheme to transport documents to Germany and copy the data into VW's computers.</p>
<p>VW had long denied the allegations but acknowledged in the settlement documents that there was a possibility of illegal activities by Lopez, who quit the VW management board in November, and others who left GM to join VW in March 1993.</p>
<p>The German carmaker VW also confirmed it had accepted the resignations of Spaniards Jose Manuel Gutierrez and Jorge Alvarez and Italian Rosario Piazza as part of the deal.</p>
<p>Herman dismissed comments by industry analysts that the deal favoured Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, and that GM, the top rival of VW in Europe, let the carmaker off easy.</p>
<p>He said the $100 million payment, to be paid within 60 days, was &quot;a massive amount of money, particularly for Germany&quot;.</p>
<p>GM officials also declined to say how they reached the $1 billion figure for VW parts purchases -- in addition to VW's current annual purchases from the U.S. group of some $300 million of parts. But Herman said the GM parts would be sold at a profit but at competitive market prices.</p>
<p>&quot;We got what we wanted, so we are happy. Could we have gotten something else or done something more, perhaps, but that did not seem as important,&quot; Herman said.</p>
