<p>More than 40 people missing after a ferry sank in Bangladesh's flooded Jamuna river were believed drowned, police said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Rescuers retrieved seven bodies and 116 people were rescued by nearby boats after the ferry sank on Tuesday in a whirlpool near Sariakandi town in the northern district of Bogra.</p>
<p>Searches by police and villagers for the missing on Wednesday proved futile.</p>
<p>&quot;We are almost certain that by now all the missing passengers including women and children are dead,&quot; police superintendent Shahadat Hossain told reporters in Bogra.</p>
<p>&quot;Even very strong, young people would find it difficult to survive so long in such a fiercely flowing river,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Divers from Dhaka who joined the rescue effort  told officials at Sariakandi that they found no bodies around the accident site.</p>
<p>&quot;The bodies may have been swept far downstream of the river by strong currents,&quot; one diver said.</p>
<p>Reporters in Bogra said earlier the death toll could be more than 50 because no one seemed to know the precise number of passengers.</p>
<p>Last month more than 50 people drowned when a ferry capsized in Bangladesh's Dhanu river, northeast of Dhaka.</p>
<p>Flooding this month has killed more than 100 people in Bangladesh.</p>
