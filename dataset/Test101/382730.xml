<p>Egypt will put on trial detained Israeli Azam Azam and three other people on charges of spying for Israel and damaging Egypt's national interests, official sources said on Monday.</p>
<p>The others are 34-year-old Egyptian Emad Abdelhamid Ismail and two Israeli women who are not in Egypt -- Mona Ahmed Shawahna and Zahra Youssef Greis.  </p>
<p>Azam, who was working at an Israeli-owned textile factory in Cairo, was detained in November on suspicion of spying. Israel said he was innocent and appealed for his release but Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said that once Israel made the case public he could not interfere with the legal system.</p>
<p>The prosecution, in investigations leaked to the Egyptian media, believe that one of the Arab-Israeli women recruited the Egyptian man after an affair facilitated by Azam.</p>
<p>The prosecution says its evidence includes clothes said to be inscribed with invisible ink but it has not said what kind of information Israel was seeking.</p>
<p>The sources said the four would face trial in the Supreme State Security Court and that public prosecutor Raga el-Arabi would ask for the harshest possible sentences.</p>
