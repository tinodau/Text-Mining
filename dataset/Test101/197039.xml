<p>The CIA became suspicious of one of its own employees, who now faces charges of spying for Russia, after he appeared to be lying on two polygraph tests in October 1995.</p>
<p>FBI agent Michael Lonergan said in a 31-page affidavit that the CIA employee, Harold Nicholson, had been given the tests as part of a routine security update.</p>
<p>The exams found a strong probabilty Nicholson, a 16-year CIA veteran who had access to some of the nation's most sensitive secrets, had been lying when asked if he was hiding involvement with or had any unauthorised contact with a foreign intelligence service.</p>
<p>During a third test in December 1995, the CIA examiner noted Nicholson appeared to be trying to manipulate the test by taking deep breaths before certain questions. The FBI agent said Nicholson stopped after a warning.</p>
<p>In building the case, Lonergan said the FBI reviewed Nicholson's frequent-flyer records, financial records from 1994 through early 1996 and information furnished by the CIA.</p>
<p>&quot;The FBI uncovered a pattern of twice-yearly foreign travel, followed by unexplained deposits and payments to Nicholson's accounts,&quot; he said,</p>
<p>The unexplained deposits, which followed trips abroad and an unauthorised meeting with Russian intelligence officers, totalled $120,000, Lonergan said.</p>
<p>&quot;The FBI has been unable to trace the source of this money to any legitimate source of income,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>FBI officials also intercepted postcards Nicholson mailed to his handlers, recovered classified information from his laptop computer, observed him photocopying classified documents and found in his office numerous classified documents about Russia that were unrelated to his CIA duties.</p>
<p>Lonergan said an audit in July of CIA computer information showed Nicholson was using his computer to conduct searches of databases for information on Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;This unauthorised activity led the CIA computer security personnel to list Nicholson as a 'surfer',&quot; the agent said.</p>
<p>Among the information the FBI believes Nicholson may have compromised were listings of CIA case officers posted abroad, including agents Nicholson may have instructed at a CIA special training centre.</p>
<p>Nicholson has held posts in Romania and Malaysia and as an instructor at the CIA's training centre in Virginia teaching espionage tradecraft to agency personnel. He was most recently working in anti-terrorism.</p>
<p>Lonergan said Nicholson may have given Moscow information summarizing what was obtained in the debriefing of Aldrich Ames -- another CIA employee who admitted spying for Moscow after being arrested in 1994.</p>
<p>Lonergan's affidavit was filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, a Washington suburb. CIA headquarters is at Langley, another Virginia suburb of the capital.</p>
