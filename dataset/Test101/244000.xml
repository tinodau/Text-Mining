<p>Volkswagen's chief executive Ferdinand Piech did an about-face on Monday, saying he regretted the trouble and costs suffered by General Motors over the 1993 transfer of a top GM executive to VW who now faces allegations of industrial spying.</p>
<p>Piech told journalists at a VW event in the French-German border city of Colmar that he regretted the &quot;turmoil, trouble and costs resulting for both companies&quot; over the transfer to VW from GM of production guru Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.</p>
<p>He also believed new talks could be set to end the fight that is nearly four years old and that VW may consider resuming buying parts from GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG.</p>
<p>But Piech said the transfer of Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, to VW was &quot;fully legal&quot; and did not comment directly on allegations that Lopez and seven other former GM associates stole secret documents when they quit the U.S. automaker.</p>
<p>GM alleges that Piech used the information to cut some 700 million marks ($451 million) of costs at Volkswagen and quickly eroded a 20 percent cost advantage that Opel had over its German rival.</p>
<p>Piech, the grandson of VW founder Ferdinand Porsche, had long said he would not apologise to GM over its allegations that VW lured away Lopez and others who brought along secret plans on car parts pricing and innovative factory plans.</p>
<p>But Piech's statement appeared aimed at meeting one of the strict conditions that GM has laid out before it would consider any deal to end its U.S. lawsuit accusing VW of racketeering and attempts to strike a new concilatory tone with GM.</p>
<p>In addition to severing ties with Lopez and his associates who left GM for Volkswagen, the Detroit carmaker has demanded since 1993 that VW issue a public apology and pay for damages.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether GM would accept Piech's statement as being sufficient, especially since GM officials said VW had missed a chance to de-escalate the dispute after Lopez quit.</p>
<p>Signs of progress in the dispute appeared in late November when Lopez resigned from the VW management board. But Lopez was replaced by Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, 39, who is also named as a defendant in the U.S. racketeering lawsuit that also lists Piech and other top VW executives as defendants.</p>
<p>Piech also said at the time that he would welcome the chance to keep working with Lopez as a consultant, which irked GM officials, and VW also agreed to pay Lopez four million marks for the balance of his contract through March 1998.</p>
<p>But Piech said he believed new talks to settle the U.S. lawsuit could resume after German prosecutors file anticipated criminal charges against Lopez, possibly as soon as this week.</p>
<p>Lopez's German lawyer has said he expects prosecutors in the suburban Frankfurt city of Darmstadt to file the charges against his client by year-end. Sources have said the charges would likely be made public in the coming days.</p>
<p>In addition, Piech said the last remaining demand by GM -- that VW pay damages for the alleged theft of documents, including pricing data on some 110,000 parts that reduced GM's price advantage in Europe -- was not a primary issue.</p>
<p>&quot;The demand for damages was for both sides so far in all talks the least important point,&quot; Piech said.</p>
<p>He said one part of the negotiations, which were last held secretly in London in September, could be VW agreeing to buy parts from GM or its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Piech said business relations with GM had been dormant for the last three years. Before that, Piech said VW bought up to 100 million marks per year from GM before the Lopez transfer.</p>
<p>VW has sought to strike the conciliatory tone after it lost a series of legal fights in the U.S. and risks facing a jury verdict totalling billions of marks since the racketeering law, first used to fight the mafia, calls for damages to be tripled.</p>
<p>Investor worries about the outcome of the U.S. lawsuit have been depressing VW shares, causing them to fall some five to seven percent in recent weeks.</p>
<p>VW shares ended trade on Monday up 5.85 marks at 602 marks, getting a boost after VW said earlier on Monday that Piech would make a comment to GM in an interview in Thursday's edition of the German magazine Stern. ($1=1.5522 Mark)</p>
