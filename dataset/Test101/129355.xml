<p>A boardroom battle at Daimler-Benz AG, Germany's largest industrial group, may be nearing a showdown because only one member opposes a planned management restructuring, sources close to the company said.</p>
<p>Six out of seven board members at Daimler favour plans to integrate the Mercedes-Benz AG luxury car unit into the parent company, sources close to the company told Reuters.</p>
<p>Also Hilmar Kopper, head of Daimler's supervisory board and management board chairman at Germany's largest commercial bank Deutsche Bank, has signalled his approval of the plan, German newsmagazine Der Spiegel reported at the weekend.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, only Helmut Werner, chief executive of the Mercedes unit and a Daimler board member, opposes the move, the sources told Reuters.</p>
<p>The situation may come to a head as early as this week when the executive committee of Daimler's supervisory board meets on Tuesday. The full supervisory board will meet on November 6.</p>
<p>Three other Mercedes board members, Kurt Lauk, Juergen Hubbert and Dieter Zetsche, have signed off on the plan, German newspapers reported at the weekend.</p>
<p>Werner, who was seen as a contender for the top job at Daimler before Juergen Schrempp was appointed to succeed retiring chief Edzard Reuter last year, may face the end of his career at the carmaker if the plan is approved.</p>
<p>Although Werner would remain on the Daimler board if Mercedes were intergrated, he would effectively be made redundant and has threatened to resign if the internal merger were agreed, the Stuttgarter Zeitung reported last week.</p>
<p>Spiegel reported that Kopper hopes to avoid having Werner leave the company.</p>
<p>The plan to fuse Mercedes with its parent company is seen as part of a drive by Daimler-Benz chief Juergen Schrempp to take Daimler back to its roots as a transport group, reversing the trend begun by Edzard Reuter to create an integrated technology holding group.</p>
<p>Mercedes said there was no official comment on Sunday, saying only that none of the Mercedes board members had been asked about the row and had not commented on it either.</p>
<p>Daimler also had no comment.</p>
<p>Analysts have said the plan would be a logical next step following the dissolution earlier this year of Daimler's loss-making AEG industrial division and the divestment of the majority-held Fokker Dutch plane-maker unit.</p>
<p>Mercedes, which now makes up around three-quarters of Daimler's group revenues, predicted that its 1996 profits will be &quot;clearly&quot; higher than last year's 2.275 billion mark profit, the Boersen Zeitung reported in its Saturday edition.</p>
<p>The paper also quoted Mercedes official Juergen Fahr as predicting 1996 sales could reach 75 billion marks, topping 1995's 72 billion mark turnover.</p>
<p>Fahr was optimistic that the group would be able to recoup production lost when plants were boycotted by workers demonstrating against Daimler's decision to adopt German law and award workers only 80 percent pay during illness.</p>
<p>Schrempp, a champion of the move for &quot;shareholder value&quot; in Germany, is under great pressure to fulfil a promise to return Daimler to profitability in 1996 after the 5.7 billion marks loss made by the group in 1995.</p>
<p>As the row progresses, some sources believed Schrempp would seek to avoid any potentially damaging power struggle with Werner and could be ready to offer him the position of deputy chairman in the reshuffled Daimler board.</p>
<p>Any integration of Mercedes-Benz was seen as likely to be accompanied by the appointment of at least three current Mercedes managers to the main board.</p>
<p>But Werner's bargaining position within the company is seen as weaker than Schrempp's in that, unlike Daimler veteran Schrempp, he is a relative newcomer to the group.</p>
