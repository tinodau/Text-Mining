<p>Shares in Volkswagen AG rose nearly three percent on Monday after Bonn proposed repealing laws governing the carmaker which analysts said will give the group more freedom and small shareholders additional clout.</p>
<p>German Justice Ministry parliamentary state secretary Rainer Funke told a Frankfurt conference that two sections of the so-called &quot;VW Laws&quot; have been proposed to be repealed that affect proxy voting rights and the maximum number of shares that can be used for voting at VW's annual general meeting.</p>
<p>But he said laws that require VW to maintain its production sites in Germany would not be affected.</p>
<p>Current law prevents anyone from exercising more than 20 percent of the voting rights in VW shares and from giving proxy rights to another person to vote on company matters, a common procedure in Germany.</p>
<p>A Volkswagen spokesman said the company viewed the changes as &quot;neutral&quot;, while a spokesman for the Lower Saxony government in Hanover said the state would not fight the rule changes.</p>
<p>VW shares ended bourse trade up 14.75 marks at 597.75 marks and advanced to a new year's record high at 608 marks in IBIS electronic dealings before trading at about 600 marks.</p>
<p>The state of Lower Saxony, where VW is based, has been the carmaker's largest shareholder with its 20 percent of VW's voting rights held since the carmaker was privatised in 1961 and its shares listed on German stock exchanges.</p>
<p>Funke said existing laws kepted the number of shareholders attending VW annual general meetings at about 40 percent of the voting rights and gave Lower Saxony considerable influence over dealings at VW, considered Europe's largest carmaker.</p>
<p>Funke, who heads a government group developing new stock market laws expected to be implemented in 1998, said in a newspaper interview on Monday that Lower Saxony would still play an important role in the dealings of Volkswagen.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone who has a 20 percent stake is still going to be strong,&quot; he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.</p>
<p>The proposals, which Funke expected to be implemented in 1998, are not expected to have an impact on day-to-day operations at VW but help in its strategic planning, particularly at a time when it considers more foreign ventures and how to deal with its massive German workforce.</p>
<p>&quot;The current laws were a millstone around VW management's neck,&quot; said one industry analyst. &quot;They blocked efforts at restructuring, made sure jobs were kept. It's a very important step in their restructuring but I do not see major change.&quot;</p>
<p>The laws to be repealed date back to when Volkswagen, founded by Ferdinand Porsche in the 1920s and who later received backing from Adolf Hitler in 1937, was a state-owned group after World War Two and its stock was sold to the public.</p>
<p>Industry analysts also said they did not see any political undertones to the proposal since Lower Saxony is led by Social Democrat minister president Gerhard Schroeder, who is expected to challenge Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the 1998 election.</p>
