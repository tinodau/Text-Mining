<headline>GM says prosecutors to file charges against Lopez.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-12-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>General Motors Corp said on Wednesday that German prosecutors have informed them that criminal charges would be filed against four former executives who allegedly stole secret documents when they quit in March 1993 to join rival Volkswagen AG.</p>
<p>The public prosecutors' office in Darmstadt near Frankfurt said earlier on Wednesday that it would hold a news conference on Friday to discuss the charges it would file against the former executives of GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG.  </p>
<p>Opel said prosecutors would file charges against former VW management board member Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, former VW executive Jose Manuel Gutierrez as well as Jorge Alvarez, an executive at VW subsidiary SEAT and VW employee Rosario Piazza.</p>
<p>&quot;By filing the charges, the Darmstadt public prosecutors' office has confirmed the suspicion of industrial espionage which Adam Opel AG has voiced right from the start,&quot; Opel said, noting it had not yet been given access to the charges.</p>
<p>Lopez resigned from VW in late November amid allegations he and the others to be named in the indictment took the secret data from GM when he left to join VW in 1993.</p>
<p>His lawyer has said that he expected criminal charges to be filed against his client.</p>
<p>Sources have said Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, would face lesser-than-expected criminal charges involving embezzlement and betrayal against GM. But the sources said the charges would not include more serious allegations involving fraud that can carry a jail term of five to 10 years.</p>
<p>The expected charges against Lopez are punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine, but first-time offenders do not usually face prison, according to legal experts.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear what charges would be filed by prosecutors against Alvarez, Gutierrez and Piazza.</p>
