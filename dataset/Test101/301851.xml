<title>GERMANY: German shareholder groups slam VW/GM settlement.</title>
<headline>German shareholder groups slam VW/GM settlement.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT, Germany</dateline>

<p>German shareholder groups over the weekend criticised the settlement of industrial espionage charges between Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp., even though the pact boosted VW shares late last week.</p>
<p>While they welcomed the end to the nearly four-year-old feud -- one of the bitterest fights in corporate history -- the groups said the deal made it impossible for minority shareholders to identify who was to blame and could end up costing stockholders a considerable amount.</p>
<p>&quot;The question arises -- who is actually supposed to pay this $100 million?&quot; Reinhild Kreitel, spokeswoman for the German small shareholders' association, told Reuters.</p>
<p>VW averted a potentially costly U.S. jury trial on Thursday when it agreed to settle GM's charges that Jose Ignacio Lopez stole valuable industrial secrets when he defected to VW in 1993.</p>
<p>VW agreed to pay GM $100 million in compensation, buy $1 billion worth of GM parts over the next seven years and retract statements such as charges that GM may have tampered with evidence before it was released to German prosecutors.</p>
<p>In return, GM agreed to drop its U.S. lawsuit in a Detroit federal court based on racketeering laws that could have led to triple damages.</p>
<p>While VW said the deal would not have a serious impact on its profits, Keitel said the shareholder lobby group was considering withholding support of VW management and the automaker's supervisory boards at the next shareholder meeting.</p>
<p>The rise of some 12 percent in VW's share price this week -- the stock closed Friday up 3 percent at 712 marks ($451) -- would not be enough to compensate shareholders for potential losses arising from the incident, Keitel said.</p>
<p>&quot;The shares had been burdened by the court case for a long time. Now they are merely making up those losses,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Ekkehard Wenger, founder of the German association for promotion of shareholder democracy, also said it would be unacceptable to expect small shareholders to pay for management errors.</p>
<p>&quot;The management board will have to come up with some explanations at the annual general meeting,&quot; he said in a telephone interview.</p>
