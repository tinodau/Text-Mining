<p>Two more bodies have been found in a scenic lake in Indonesia's North Sumatra province where an overloaded ferry sank on Sunday night, pushing the death toll to 77, the official Antara news agency reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Two more bodies, which are the victims of K.M. Pedaltari have been found by the rescue officials,&quot; said Antara.</p>
<p>The agency earlier said as many as 100 people could have died in the accident on lake Toba when the ferry capsized on its way from Parapat on the shore of the lake to Tomok on the island of Samosir, which is on the middle of the lake.</p>
<p>Rescue officials said more than 150 people were believed to have been on the wooden ferry, which had a maximum legal capacity of between 50 and 60 people, said Antara.</p>
<p>It said the ferry's captain Opo Sihotang was among the missing, either because he had drowned or had run away.</p>
<p>Police in Medan, the capital of North Sumatra, earlier said the death toll could increase as the search continued. They said passengers were returning to their hometowns after attending an annual cultural festival in Parapat.</p>
<p>No foreigners were among the passengers, police said.</p>
<p>Antara quoted survivors as saying they heard loud cracking noises before the ferry sank and that water quickly flooded into the boat.</p>
