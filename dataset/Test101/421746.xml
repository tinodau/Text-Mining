<title>EGYPT: Egypt to try Israeli Azam for spying in April.</title>
<headline>Egypt to try Israeli Azam for spying in April.</headline>

<p>An Egyptian judge set April 24 for the start of the trial of an Israeli man and three other people on charges of spying for Israel and damaging Egypt's national interests, judicial sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Israeli man is Azam Azam, a 35-year-old chief mechanic at an Israeli-owned factory in Egypt, arrested in November.</p>
<p>His case has added to the friction in Egyptian-Israeli relations and the judge set the trial date on the eve of a visit to Cairo by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Israel says Azam is innocent and has called for his release but President Hosni Mubarak said that once Israel made the case public he could not interfere with the legal system.</p>
<p>An Egyptian, Emad Abdelhamid Ismail, 34, and two Israeli women who are out of Egypt -- Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna -- are the other defendants in the case.</p>
<p>The Supreme State Security Court will try the four at the South Cairo court building. Security sources have said the public prosecutor will ask for the harshest possible sentence, which would be life imprisonment with hard labour.</p>
<p>The prosecutor general referred the four to trial after issuing the charge sheet, which says Ismail agreed to help the two women spy for Israel's intelligence service Mossad. The prosecution alleged that Ismail worked with Mossad from March to October last year.</p>
<p>Greiss, with whom the prosecution says he was having an affair, gave Ismail $650 when he was recruited and Shawahna offered to pay him $1,000 a month if he helped Mossad, the charge sheet said.</p>
<p>Azam's alleged role in the espionage case was to deliver to Ismail women's underwear inscribed with invisible ink.</p>
<p>The prosecution has not said what information Israel was seeking. Ismail &quot;received the necessary training to carry out his assignments with the intention of harming the state's interest&quot;, the charge sheet said.</p>
<p>It said Azam and Ismail had both confessed. But Azam denied the espionage charges in December in his first public appearance in an Egyptian court for a hearing to extend his detention.</p>
<p>The charge sheet said Ismail told interrogators he was recruited when he went to Israel last February to train at a women's garments factory. The Egyptian told interrogators he became acquainted with Greiss at the factory and shortly afterwards began taking him out to have sex in her car.</p>
<p>Egypt became the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in 1979 but relations have cooled significantly since Netanyahu took office in June.</p>
