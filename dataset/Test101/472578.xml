<p>The former Volkswagen AG executive at the centre of a four-year industrial spying battle between VW and General Motors Corp. described his work at VW as an &quot;extremely great success&quot; and said he would write a book one day about how he left the automaker.</p>
<p>In an interview with German daily Bild-Zeitung published Thursday, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who has been charged in Germany with betraying corporate secrets, said he helped VW to become the &quot;Number One in Europe, in Brazil, in China, in Mexico.&quot;</p>
<p>Lopez, a renowned cost-cutter whose move from General Motors to VW sparked a four-year legal battle, quit VW last November following a series of adverse court rulings.</p>
<p>He has since set up his own consulting firm, Lopez de Arriortua &amp; Co, and has already conducted a dozen seminars for clients in Europe.</p>
<p>Referring to his time at VW, Lopez said, &quot;I was able to work with many good people, also with geniuses like (Management Board Chairman) Dr. (Ferdinand) Piech. Together we managed the turnaround at VW.&quot;</p>
<p>Lopez's departure from VW, where his cost-cutting helped return the carmaker to profitability, paved the way for an out-of-court settlement in which VW agreed to pay GM $100 million in compensation and buy $1 billion worth of GM parts in return for GM dropping a civil racketeering suit in the U.S.</p>
<p>GM alleged that Lopez and other former GM managers stole secrets about research, planning and purchasing for new factories as well as GM cars under development when they defected to VW in 1993. VW and Lopez consistently denied the charges.</p>
<p>Interviewed in Bilbao in his home Basque region, Lopez said his new company offered prospective clients advice on how to cut costs by 50 percent in three years.</p>
<p>Asked whether he was glad to have retired from day-to-day work as VW production chief, Lopez said:</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know the story of the gazelle and the lion? Both wake up in the jungle and realise they must go on to survive; the gazelle to flee the lion, the lion to catch the gazelle.</p>
<p>&quot;It does not matter if you're a gazelle or a lion. As soon as the sun rises you must move -- otherwise things look bad for you.&quot;</p>
<p>German prosecutors in December filed charges against Lopez and three other former GM employees, Jose Manuel Gutierrez, Rosario Piazza and Jorge Alvarez, who followed Lopez to VW in March 1993. They are accused of taking more than 20,000 documents and computer discs with millions of pages of secret GM data with them when they joined VW.</p>
<p>If convicted, they could face up to five years in prison or a fine. But legal experts say first-time offenders do not usually face prison.</p>
<p>The charges must now be reviewed by a court, which will determine whether the evidence supports the allegations. Prosecutors declined to predict when a trial could begin.</p>
