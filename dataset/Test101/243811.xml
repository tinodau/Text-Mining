<headline>GM official says Piech comments &quot;insufficent&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-12-09</dateline>

<p>A top executive at General Motors Corp said on Monday that comments by VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech expressing regret about the turmoil and trouble between the two companies were insufficient for any new talks on settling a U.S. lawsuit alleging racketeering.</p>
<p>&quot;Piech's statements are insufficent and cannot be taken seriously,&quot; the GM official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters in Frankfurt.  </p>
<p>He said VW must admit to wrongdoing over the issue involving former VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and said no settlement talks over the U.S. civil lawsuit were currently planned.</p>
<p>Piech earlier on Monday said he regretted the trouble and costs suffered by GM over the 1993 transfer of a top GM executive to VW who now faces allegations of industrial spying.</p>
<p>Piech told journalists at a VW event in the French-German border city of Colmar that he regretted the &quot;turmoil, trouble and costs resulting for both companies&quot; over the transfer to VW from GM of production guru Lopez to the Wolfsburg carmaker.  </p>
<p>He also believed new talks could be set to end the fight that is nearly four years old and that VW may consider resuming buying parts from GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG.</p>
<p>But Piech said the transfer of Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, to VW was &quot;fully legal&quot; and did not comment directly on allegations that Lopez and seven other former GM associates stole secret documents when they quit the U.S. automaker.</p>
<p>&quot;It does not meet our conditions,&quot; the GM official said. &quot;Our conditions are that VW acknowledge the wrongdoing, sever all ties with Lopez and his collaborators and compensate GM and Opel for the damages.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Regret alone will not be sufficient,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>&quot;Piech has expressed regret for confusion and aggravation. What we are interested in having done, is wrongdoings being righted. The place to do that is in the courts of law by moving the case to trial as soon as possible,&quot; the source said.</p>
