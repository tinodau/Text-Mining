<p>Earl Pitts, a former FBI agent who sold U.S. national security documents to Moscow, was sentenced on Monday to 27 years in prison.</p>
<p>The penalty for Pitts, a 13-year FBI veteran and counter-intelligence expert, was stiffer than federal prosecutors had sought. Even his own attorney said Pitts had made &quot;horrible decisions&quot; and committed &quot;terrible actions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What I did was wrong and harmful, pure and simple,&quot; Pitts said before sentencing in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington.</p>
<p>He praised his former FBI colleagues, adding, &quot;My actions, my crimes should not be used to diminish the efforts that they put forth.&quot;</p>
<p>Standing before the judge in prison garb with the word &quot;PRISONER&quot; stenciled on the back, Pitts told federal Judge T.S. Ellis that he sold secrets to Soviet and then Russian officials out of &quot;unreasonable anger that I felt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have much more reflection to do on that,&quot; Ellis responded, noting that Pitts had made no reference to money or betrayal of country in his statement of apology and remorse. &quot;You certainly did it in part for simple greed.&quot;</p>
<p>Ellis, who presided over more than three hours of legal debate before pronouncing sentence, made repeated mention of Pitts' abuse of trust as a counter-intelligence agent.</p>
<p>&quot;You betrayed your country, you betrayed your government, your fellow workers and all of us, really,&quot; Ellis said. &quot;Every time you go by Arlington (National Cemetery) ... every name you see on the Vietnam Memorial ... you betrayed them especially.&quot;</p>
<p>Pitts, now 44, was arrested on Dec. 18 for passing vital national security secrets to Russian intelligence agencies in exchange for $224,000 from 1987 to 1996, betraying some of the FBI's most sensitive operations.</p>
<p>During Monday's hearing, federal prosecutors noted Pitts' willingness to betray his FBI colleagues, saying he offered his contacts such information as the number of children certain agents had and where they lived.</p>
<p>Pitts, said to be motivated by money, was caught as a result of a 16-month undercover FBI sting and was dismissed by the agency in January. He had been in the FBI's New York City unit responsible for catching Russian spies.</p>
<p>He was charged in a 12-count indictment with attempted espionage, conspiracy to commit espionage, communication of classified information and conveyance of government property without authorisation.</p>
<p>Pitts pleaded guilty to the two most serious espionage charges. In exchange, prosecutors agreed to drop the remaining 10 charges. Pitts also agreed to cooperate.</p>
