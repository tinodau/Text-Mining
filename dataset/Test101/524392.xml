<title>UKRAINE: IMF visits Ukraine to review reforms, new credit.</title>
<headline>IMF visits Ukraine to review reforms, new credit.</headline>

<p>An International Monetary Fund mission began meetings with top ministers in Kiev on Monday to review progress on the long-delayed budget, which would pave the way for receipt of a multi-billion dollar IMF credit.</p>
<p>The international funding body is waiting to issue a three-year, $2.5 to $3 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) credit on condition that the former Soviet republic of 51 million people passes the tough budget and a series of tax reform laws to underpin it.</p>
<p>&quot;The main goal of the meetings is to review and agree upon conditions which will be included in the memorandum to grant Ukraine a credit for structural reform,&quot; an Economy Ministry statement said.</p>
<p>IMF officials were not available for comment, but the statement added that Economy Minister Yuri Yekhanurov met an IMF technical group last week.</p>
<p>&quot;Questions were discussed about the general situation which has emerged in Ukraine regarding implementation of macro-economic reforms, and how well Ukraine was fulfilling previously agreed conditions which must be put into effect before the credit can be received,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>Both the budget and proposed laws have been caught between the government and a largely conservative parliament reluctant to implement further tough measures in President Leonid Kuchma's economic reform programme launched in late 1994.</p>
<p>Ukraine's economy has shrunk every year since independence six years ago, with a drop in gross domestic product of 10 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>Foreign investment has been low, the shadow economy has grown, and a $3.1 billion wage debt owed to workers is expanding.</p>
<p>The budget, which was due January 1, led a top economic adviser to say at the weekend Ukraine could lose the confidence of Western funding bodies and investors and even risked economic collapse.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope that the president, parliament and government could agree to work every day around the clock to fix this crisis,&quot; Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute for International Development, told a news conference.</p>
