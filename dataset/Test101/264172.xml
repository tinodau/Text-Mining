<p>The FBI arrested its own agent, Earl Edwin Pitts, on Wednesday for allegedly selling national security secrets to Russia since 1987 for more than $224,000 in the second spy case to erupt in a month.</p>
<p>The FBI said the arrest of Pitts, a 13-year veteran, capped a 16-month undercover operation, with U.S. agents posing as Russian spies and the use of a former Russian (corrects from KGB) officer at the United Nations in New York who later became an FBI informant.</p>
<p>FBI officials unveiled the evidence against Pitts, including a call from his wife -- herself an ex-FBI employee -- suspicious of his activites and a letter he wrote last week admitting giving the Russians all he could from 1987 to 1992.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing was sacred to Pitts. He was willing to betray his country, his agency and his fellow agents,&quot; U.S. Attorney Helen Fahey, whose office will prosecute the case, told a news conference at FBI headquarters.</p>
<p>It marked the second spy case to rock Washington and Moscow in a month. The FBI on Nov. 18 arrested veteran CIA officer Harold Nicholson on charges of spying for Russia.</p>
<p>Pitts, who had been in the New York FBI unit responsible for catching Russian spies, was arrested where he now works at the FBI's training facility in Quantico, Virginia.</p>
<p>Pitts, a 43-year-old lawyer who conducted security briefings for FBI personnel at the facility, was taken into custody without incident, and invoked his legal right to have an attorney, FBI officials said.</p>
<p>He was charged with attempted espionage, conspiracy to commit espionage, communication of classified information and conveyance without authority of government property.</p>
<p>Pitts was taken to federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, where a federal judge ordered him held in jail pending a bail hearing, set tentatively for Friday. A slightly built man with close-cropped brown hair, Pitts faces a maximum penalty of life in prison, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>FBI Director Louis Freeh said the agency became suspicious of Pitts after it recruited the unidentified Russian (corrects from KGB) official, who was described in court papers as a &quot;cooperating witness.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the FBI at the same time in the spring of 1993 was suspicious a Russian role may have penetrated the FBI's New York office, based on the failure of various operations. Pitts's financial and travel records also raised questions.</p>
<p>The FBI in August 1995 began the undercover or &quot;false flag&quot; operation, with the Russian (corrects from KGB) official who knew Pitts in New York contacting him again at his home in Virginia. He introduced Pitts to a U.S. agent posing as a Russian spy.</p>
<p>When his wife Mary, a former FBI support employee, saw Pitts meeting with the Russian on August 26, 1995, she contacted the FBI about his &quot;suspicious&quot; activities.</p>
<p>During the undercover operation, Pitts made 22 drops of FBI internal classified information, officials said.</p>
<p>An FBI affidavit said Pitts gave the Russians sensitive classified documents on U.S. national defence and personal, medical, and family information about other FBI agents and proposed strategies by which Russia might recruit more agents.</p>
<p>He also allegedly made plans to smuggle a Russian intelligence technical expert into the FBI academy and gave his Russian handlers an FBI cipher lock combination, an FBI key and his own FBI identification badge.</p>
<p>Freeh said the FBI had yet to complete the damage assessment from the alleged spying, but said Pitts did pose a &quot;continuing threat to national security.&quot; Pitts allegedly did compromise the identity of FBI asset who reported covertly on Russian intelligence matters.</p>
<p>The FBI chief said the case did not appear to be as damaging as that involving Aldrich Ames, the confessed CIA turncoat arrested in 1994 for betraying numerous agents and passing along some of the nation's most sensitive secrets.</p>
