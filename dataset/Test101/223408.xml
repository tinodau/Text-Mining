<p>German shares powered ahead to new record highs on Thursday, boosted by strength in the German bond market and a firmer dollar, which helped shares in stocks of many German exporters climb to new ground.</p>
<p>Even the lack of the U.S. market, which often provides direction for the German market but which was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, could not dampen the rally.</p>
<p>The DAX index of 30 top shares ended bourse trade on Thursday at a record closing high of 2,817.49 points, up 0.73 percent, or 20.46 points, after the dollar raced up to its highest level for a month against the mark.</p>
<p>The dollar penetrated the crucial 1.53 mark level after the Bank of France monetary policy council member Jean-Pierre Gerard said he favoured a stronger dollar against the mark.</p>
<p>Later, in the last half hour of post-bourse electronic dealings, the IBIS DAX lept ahead even further, ending at 2,829.68 points, up 1.28 percent, or 35.82 points, earlier making a record of 2,832.30 points.</p>
<p>The late surge came after the December German Bund future made a new all-time high.</p>
<p>The strength in the dollar meant that much of the day's rally was led by shares in the export-oriented autos and chemicals sectors.</p>
<p>Most of the major German chemical companies charged ahead, with shares in BASF AG gaining most to end computer trade up almost three percent at 56.10 marks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the car sector, the biggest gainer was BMW, also gaining almost three percent and mounting the 1,000 mark level for the first time ever to end up 27.60 marks at 1000.10 marks.</p>
<p>Shares in Europe's largest carmaker Volkswagen continued to be at the centre of attention and recovered some ground, closing IBIS dealings up six marks at 614 marks.</p>
<p>The stock had fallen six percent on Wednesday after a U.S. court ruling that could open VW to potentially much higher damages in a lawsuit with Opel, a subsidiary of U.S. carmaker General Motors.</p>
<p>On Thursday, sources close to the company said production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, at the centre of alleged industrial espionage charges, was likely to offer his resignation on Friday.  REUTER</p>
