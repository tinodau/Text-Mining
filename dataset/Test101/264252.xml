<p>The arrest on Wednesday of yet another alleged Russian agent inside a U.S. intelligence agency shows the spy-against-spy game dies hard and could complicate post-Cold War U.S.-Russian ties, U.S. experts said.</p>
<p>FBI director Louis Freeh said the arrest of one of his own after a 16-month sting operation ended a &quot;significant threat to our national security and to the integrity of the Federal Bureau of Investigation by the Russian intelligence service.&quot;</p>
<p>But Freeh, who spoke at a news conference together with Attorney General Janet Reno, acknowledged that U.S. intelligence agencies were continuing their own long-standing efforts to recruit Russians and steal Moscow's secrets.</p>
<p>With agents like alleged FBI turncoat Earl Pitts, Freeh said, the Russians' primary goal was to identify &quot;assets and informants&quot; that U.S. intelligence agencies have signed up.</p>
<p>&quot;They're interested in our recruitment methods. They're interested in all of our secret documents. They're interested in our tradecraft and our techniques,&quot; Freeh told reporters.</p>
<p>Pitts, a 13-year veteran of the FBI, began selling the KGB Soviet intelligence service U.S. spy-catching secrets in July 1987, the FBI alleged in an affadavit. It said he received from the KGB and its Russian successor, the SVRR, at least $224,000 through October, 1992, when he became &quot;dormant.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. attorney Helen Fahey told the news conference that Pitts, a 43-year-old attorney, had given law enforcement personnel posing as Russian spymasters personal information about fellow FBI agents who might be &quot;vulnerable to recruitment by Moscow.&quot;</p>
<p>Pitts listened to the charges against him silently at a pre-trial hearing in the same Alexandria, Virginia, courtroom that was used last month for Harold Nicholson, a 16-year Central Intelligence Agency veteran accused of selling Moscow national security secrets for 29 months until his Nov. 16 arrest.</p>
<p>U.S. officials made clear that Pitts' alleged sell-out did far less damage to U.S. security than Nicholson's or that of Aldrich Ames, a 31-year CIA veteran who confessed in April 1994 to unamasking dozens of Soviet and other agents secretly in U.S. pay.</p>
<p>But the cumulative impact of the case, compounding as it does the Cold War echoes of the Nicholson and Ames cases, is likely to chill lawmakers considering aid to Russia on Capitol Hill, U.S. analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything that even smacks of being charitable is going to come under greater scrutiny,&quot; said Harley Balzer, a Russia expert at the federally funded U.S. Institute of Peace and professor at Georgetown University. &quot;It's happening anyway and this is simply going to enhance that.&quot;</p>
<p>At least partly because of the impact of such spy cases, Balzer said in telephone interview, he expected little support for programmes set up to provide food and economic help. Instead, the focus would remain squarely on aid for such tasks as dismantling nuclear weapons and dealing with ecologic ills that could become a common threat.</p>
<p>But the fact that both the United States and Russia continue to have a huge appetite for each other's secrets should come as no surprise, experts who have monitored intelligence agencies said.</p>
<p>After engaging in worldwide cloak-and-dagger mortal combat during the Cold War, both sides continue their espionage above all to make sure they are not taken by military surprise, said Loch Johnson, author of the 1996 book &quot;Secret Agencies: U.S. Intelligence in a Hostile World.&quot;</p>
<p>Other key reasons for continued spying include wanting to know what others are preparing to do at international conferences on a wide range of issues and advancing foreign trade prospects, said Johnson, a veteran staff member of congressional intelligence oversight panels.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to have spying forever, no doubt, or at least until men become angels,&quot; he said. &quot;And unfortunately we're also going to have traders forever.&quot;</p>
