<p>Volkswagen AG chief executive Ferdinand Piech said on Tuesday an internal probe of allegations of a widespread &quot;network&quot; of corruption at the German carmaker has so far shown that it does not exist.</p>
<p>Piech, in his first public comments about allegations that some VW employees have demanded and received bribes in return for contracts, said the carmaker's probe has so far turned up only one employee who has since been suspended.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not yet have an indication of a network. We have so far identified one employee at Volkswagen and he has been suspended,&quot; Piech told Reuters at the Geneva car show.</p>
<p>Piech also said the corruption allegations, which are centred on a plant expansion contract for VW's Czech Skoda unit that was awarded to Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB, involved &quot;a nearly double-digit sum in the millions of marks&quot;.</p>
<p>Piech said the amount in dispute with ABB involved VW paying an extra 5.7 million marks for one contract and losing another 3.7 million marks that ABB should have paid for delays, if they had been notified in time of the project deadline.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not think comments are appropriate at this time since the matter is under investigation by the relevant authorities,&quot; an ABB spokesman in Zurich said Wednesday.</p>
<p>ABB made allegations last December that a VW employee had demanded bribes for the Skoda contract and that it would not pay the disputed costs, prompting both companies to contact German and Swiss public prosecutors.</p>
<p>The figures involved are well below German media reports that have said the contract was worth some 400 million marks and included bribes of about 20 million marks.</p>
<p>VW officials on Wednesday said the carmaker's purchasing division in the summer of 1994 had approved a 74 million mark contract for the Skoda paint factory and a second contract worth 38 million marks to expand the facility.</p>
<p>German prosecutors in Braunschweig have said they were investigating two suspects as part of their probe at VW, brought about by the carmaker in a formal legal request.</p>
<p>Sources close to the investigation said the VW employee who has been suspended is a long-time employee.</p>
<p>Another VW employee, who was involved with transporting VW's test vehicles, has been put in investigative custody by prosecutors on allegations of filing false expense accounts.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not clear yet whether this person is involved with these allegations of corruption but we doubt it,&quot; the source told Reuters.</p>
