<p>Fistfights broke out on Sunday between Egyptian lawyers at the trial of Israeli Druze textile mechanic Azam Azam, accused of spying against Egypt for Israel.</p>
<p>Azam, 35, and alleged Egyptian accomplice Emad Abdelhamid Ismail, who were kept in a courtroom cage, are charged with two Israeli Druze women of making a criminal agreement to spy for Israel's secret service, Mossad. The women are being tried in absentia.</p>
<p>Azam's lawyer Farid el-Deeb said his client faced a maximum of 15 years in prison with hard labour whereas Ismail could face life imprisonment with hard labour because he was a state-employed teacher. Ismail's lawyer said the maximum punishment for all defendants could be life imprisonment.</p>
<p>One lawyer, representing the Egyptian Lawyers' Union, accused Azam's attorney of being a traitor for agreeing to represent the Israeli.</p>
<p>Assistants for the two lawyers were entangled in fistfights and swore at each other as soon as the judge left the courtroom after he adjourned the trial till June 14.</p>
<p>&quot;The (lawyers') union will hold a disciplinary hearing on this lawyer (Deeb). He has sold his conscience and betrayed his country for $4 million,&quot; said Mortada Mohsen, referring to what he said was the fee Azam's family paid Deeb.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to raise a civil case demanding $100 million compensation from the Israeli government, Azam and his co-defendants and donate it to the martyrs of the Qana massacre that Israel carried out,&quot; Mohsen told reporters.</p>
<p>About 100 people were killed after Israeli shells hit a U.N. military base in Qana, Lebanon in April 1996.</p>
<p>The judge turned down Mohsen's request to add the civil suit to the case, being heard at South Cairo State Security court, and said that if Deeb had not agreed to represent Azam, the court would have appointed another Egyptian lawyer.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an attempt to disrupt the court proceedings,&quot; Deeb said of Mohsen's charges. &quot;To say I am a traitor is libellous, and I will not respond to libel.&quot;</p>
<p>Azam's brother denied his family agreed to pay Deeb $4 million but said he was still optimistic Azam would be set free.</p>
<p>&quot;If we had $4 million we would have been rich. We are poor, simple people. We collected money from people and we still haven't paid the fee,&quot; said Sami Azam. &quot;Azam is innocent and I am very optimistic that he will go home, God willing.&quot;</p>
<p>Sami said Mohsen was upset because Azam's family had considered hiring him but chose Deeb instead.</p>
<p>&quot;I would have completely refused. I can't betray my country. When (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu first came here I sent a telegram to the Israeli embassy in Cairo saying 'Leave the pure land of Egypt, you dirty person',&quot; Mohsen said.</p>
<p>The trial, which started on April 24, has brought Egyptian-Israeli relations to one of their lowest ebbs since the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979.</p>
<p>At one point in the session, state security policemen had to encircle the bench where Israeli diplomats and Azam's family and friends were sitting to protect them from one lawyer who insisted they be moved to make room for him.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a shame that an Egyptian lawyer can curse our prime minister here in public,&quot; said David Govrin, first secretary at the Israeli embassy.</p>
<p>&quot;We hope the court will release Azam. We know the charges are baseless and we're waiting for the decision of the court. We are 100 percent sure that Azam is innocent,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Egyptian state security prosecutors on May 5 brought a new, more severe charge against Azam, accusing him of agreeing with Ismail and the two women to spy for Mossad.</p>
<p>His previous charge was that he assisted in economic espionage by giving women's underwear inscribed with invisible ink form Mossad to Ismail.</p>
<p>Prosecutors state in the charge sheet that Mossad wanted information on Egyptian factories. They said the women offered Ismail money to work for Mossad when he went to Israel in 1996 to train at a women's garment factory.</p>
