<p>A lawyer representing Volkswagen AG executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua said on Friday he expected German prosecutors to file industrial spying charges against Lopez by the end of the month.</p>
<p>The lawyer, Juergen Taschke, said in a statement issued by his Frankfurt office that he &quot;still expected in November&quot; charges to be filed against Lopez.</p>
<p>Taschke issued the statement after he told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Friday that he expected Lopez and three other VW workers to face charges for allegedly taking secret data with them when they left rival General Motors Corp in 1993.</p>
<p>The three other executives -- identified as Jose Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez and Rosario Piazza -- left Opel, the German unit of Detroit-based GM, when Lopez left for VW in March 1993 and joined the German carmaker's management board.</p>
<p>The German charges will relate to allegations that Lopez, who ran GM's worldwide purchasing operations, and other officials took secrets related to the design of a new manufacturing concept known as &quot;Plant X&quot;, Taschke told the newspaper.</p>
<p>VW, which has consistently denied the allegations, declined comment on Friday on the report but said Lopez would stay with the company even if he were to face criminal charges.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman for the Frankfurt prosecutors' office declined comment on Taschke's statements, saying a decision would be made by year-end on whether criminal charges would be brought against Lopez and the other executives.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not commenting on whether a decision has already been taken to bring charges or to terminate proceedings,&quot; said the office spokeswoman, Hildegard Becker-Toussaint.</p>
<p>VW sources said the Wolfsburg-based company, the largest carmaker in Europe, was preparing itself for the charges to be filed against Lopez and the executives, who were top and middle-level managers who reported to him.</p>
<p>Lopez, a Basque, has been renowned for his ability to streamline production and cut costs, established innovative working practices at Europe's largest carmaker that have helped VW to return to profitability.</p>
<p>GM, in waging a nearly four-year legal battle in the U.S. and Germany against VW, has alleged that VW used the secret information and other confidential data to build a new production plant in Brazil.</p>
