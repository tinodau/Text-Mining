<headline>Croatia says no economic reason for IMF loan delay.</headline>

<p>Croatia's central bank said on Wednesday there was no economic reason for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to delay discussion about the next tranche of a $486 million credit to Croatia.</p>
<p>The fund was expected by now to approve the second tranche of the extended fund facility (EFF), issued in March under a three-year programme of support to Croatia's reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;The move of the IMF's board of directors is unusual and from the economic point of view inexplicable, particularly since the first review... in May confirmed Croatia was implementing the agreed policies,&quot; the bank said in a statement faxed to Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;In other words, there were no obstacles to continuing with success an exceptionally correct cooperation of this international financial institution with our country,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Although the IMF's expert bodies and most of its executive directors were said to have given a green light for the second tranche, its board postponed discussion until the end of July.</p>
<p>But the bank said the delay would have no economic consequences since the funds were aimed to strengthen its already solid foreign currency reserves. Croatia was supposed to draw on a total of $158 million this year.</p>
<p>&quot;This decision (by the IMF) will by no means spur any changes of Croatia's monetary and economic policy... We believ that the IMF and World Bank will soon be able to resume their support...,&quot; the bank added.</p>
<p>The World Bank under U.S. pressure last month also put off indefinitely $30 million in technical support intended for helping private investments in Croatia. The Croatian government condemned the decision it described as a tool of political pressure on the country. -- Kolumbina Bencevic, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075</p>
