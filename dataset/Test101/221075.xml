<headline>Judge sets March 10 trial date for accused CIA spy.</headline>
<dateline>ALEXANDRIA, Va. 1996-11-27</dateline>

<p>Accused CIA double-agent Harold Nicholson pleaded innocent on Wednesday to charges of conspiracy to spy for Russia and a judge set March 10 as a trial date.</p>
<p>Judge James Cacheris also said he was imposing a gag order on lawyers for both sides and on officials of the Justice Department and the Central Intelligence Agency in the case of Nicholson, a former CIA station chief who was arrested on Nov. 16. He is being held without bond pending trial.  </p>
<p>Nicholson waived his right to a jury trial within 70 days. The slight delay gives his lawyers more time to obtain security clearances they need to review much of the government's evidence.</p>
<p>Asked how Nicholson, the highest-ranking CIA official ever charged with espionage, would plead, defence lawyer Jonathan Shapiro said, &quot;not guilty.&quot;</p>
<p>Nicholson, 46, was asked by the judge if he understood that he was giving up his rights under a federal speedy-trial law. &quot;Yes I do, your honour,&quot; he replied in a strong voice.</p>
<p>A one-count indictment handed up by a federal grand jury last week accused him of taking more than $180,000 for spying for Moscow from June 1994 until his arrest. During that time he allegedly handed over classified documents and unmasked undercover CIA officers.</p>
