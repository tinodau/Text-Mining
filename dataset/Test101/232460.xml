<headline>Audi names Paefgen as new CEO - sources.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-12-03</dateline>

<p>Audi AG, the luxury carmaking unit of German carmaker Volkswagen AG, has decided to name Franz-Josef Paefgen as its new management board chairman, industry sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The appointment of Paefgen to lead the Ingolstadt-based carmaker comes after reports on Tuesday that current Audi management board chairman Herbert Demel has been chosen to lead the Latin American business of parent company Volkswagen.  </p>
<p>An Audi spokesman declined comment on the leadership change at the carmaker and the transfer of Demel to VW following the resignation last Friday of VW management board member Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.</p>
<p>Lopez, who had led the Latin American operations, is the target of a German criminal probe reviewing allegations that he and other former executive at Opel AG stole secret documents when they abruptly quit to join VW in March 1993.</p>
<p>Several German newspapers have recently reported that Demel, an Austrian who had been in charge at Audi for 2-1/2 years, would give up his position and take up responsibility for Volkswagen's Latin American business.</p>
<p>Paefgen, 50, joined the Audi management board in March 1994 and has been responsible for technical development. He started his career in the car industry as a trainee in 1976 with the German unit of Ford Motor Corp and joined Audi in 1980.</p>
<p>Audi confirmed earlier on Tuesday that its supervisory board would meet in the Hungarian town of Gyor on Wednesday and that personnel issues would be discussed at the meeting.</p>
<p>The spokesman also said there could be a decision at the meeting on a possible new Audi factory in Brazil.</p>
<p>Sources in the motor industry say that the plant would involve hundreds of millions of marks in investments.</p>
<p>Audi has long planned a car production plant in the dollar region to better latch on to the U.S. market.</p>
<p>In 1995 Audi sold nearly 3,400 vehicles in Latin America, with the main market in Brazil. VW sells around 700,000 vehicles in the dollar region, the Audi spokesman said.</p>
