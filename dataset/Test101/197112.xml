<p>A Frankfurt court will decide this week whether to hand over to U.S. authorities the results of a German investigation into allegations of industrial espionage against senior Volkswagen AG executives.</p>
<p>A Frankfurt appellate court spokesman said on Monday a decision on a request by the U.S. Department of Justice and FBI for data from the German probe into VW executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua &quot;would come in the course of the week&quot;.</p>
<p>Volkswagen AG has filed a lawsuit in the Frankfurt court to try to prevent information concerning Lopez and other top VW executives collected by German prosecutors from being sent to U.S. investigators, court spokesman Wolfgang Frank said.</p>
<p>U.S. authorities began their own independent criminal investigation into the allegations of spying in 1993, shortly after Lopez abruptly quit Opel, a unit of General Motors Corp, to join Wolfsburg-based VW, the largest carmaker in Europe.</p>
<p>VW denies any wrongdoing and has continued to support Lopez.</p>
<p>Lopez has been under investigation for allegedly taking confidential documents from Opel and GM, which have waged a four-year legal battle in the U.S. and Germany against him.</p>
<p>VW on Monday said a German court had also set a date to resume reviewing the allegations Opel made about the alleged theft of secret documents when Lopez and others joined VW.</p>
<p>VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said that the labour court in Braunschweig, Germany, had set September 23, 1997 for the case to be resumed.</p>
<p>VW had sought to have the U.S. lawsuit dismissed because it was similar to the legal battle in the German labour court. It wanted the case settled in its home country.</p>
<p>&quot;It won't affect it immediately because there are different legal cultures. But it will affect the credibility of Opel because their point is that they had to go to Detroit to seek justice,&quot; Kocks said.</p>
<p>&quot;Now they have the chance to do it in Germany,&quot; he said. &quot;Our perspective is that they are angry but they do not have any evidence. This is a smear campaign.&quot;</p>
<p>Lopez, a Basque renowned for his ability to streamline production and cut carmaking costs, established innovative working practices at VW that helped the carmaker return to profitability.</p>
<p>A lawyer for Lopez said in early November that he expected German prosecutors to file industrial spying charges by the end of the year against Lopez. He is also the target of a civil lawsuit in the United States filed by GM against senior VW officials, including VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech.</p>
<p>The lawyer said he expected the German charges to relate to allegations that Lopez and others took secret plans related to the design of a super-efficient manufacturing plan called &quot;Plant X&quot; that GM had under development.</p>
<p>Three other VW executives in the German criminal probe, who have been identified as Jose Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez and Rosario Piazza, left Opel shortly after Lopez defected to VW and allegedly helped bring documents to VW, he said.</p>
<p>Volkswagen has suffered a series of legal defeats in its battle against GM in recent weeks.</p>
<p>A U.S. court refused in October to throw out the civil charges filed by GM and a Frankfurt court rejected in early November a 10 million mark ($6.64 million) defamation lawsuit against statements made by GM and Opel executives about VW.</p>
