<p>A federal judge dealt a major blow to Volkswagen AG Wednesday and allowed a General Motors Corp lawsuit -- which alleges the German automaker stole corporate secrets -- to proceed in the heart of the American automotive capitol.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds denied a motion from VW to dismiss the lawsuit after hearing arguments from Richard Denvir, an attorney representing VW.</p>
<p>Denvir said the suit should be dismissed because it duplicates cases in Germany, is mostly a European matter and would be inconvenient for the majority of witnesses, who live in Germany and other parts of Europe. He estimated the cost of interpreters and translating 10,000 pages of documents could be more than $5 million.</p>
<p>&quot;This case does uniquely belong here in Detroit,&quot; Edmunds said. &quot;I believe there will be inconviences to some witnesses, regardless of where the case is tried. I don't see the balance of hardship leaning strongly one way or the other.&quot;</p>
<p>GM filed its lawsuit in U.S. District Court here last March. It alleges that VW's top production chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and several other executives stole trade secrets, including product plans, parts purchasing information and plans for a super-efficient manufacturing concept when they defected to VW in March 1993.</p>
<p>Lopez had been GM's top purchasing executive when he abruptly left to join the German automaker, setting in motion the now three-year saga.</p>
<p>Edmunds' ruling could mean that top VW executives, including Chairman Ferdinand Piech, could be forced to testify in GM's hometown. It could also expose VW to the more lenient rules of discovery and fact-finding allowed by U.S. courts.</p>
<p>Attorney Eugene Driker, who represented GM, told Edmunds Volkswagen sought to have the case dismissed because the German automaker wants to avoid having its executives testify under oath in a U.S. court. He dismissed arguments about inconveniencing VW executives.</p>
<p>&quot;There can't be a more important concern to this court than the ability of the automotible industry to protect itself from the theft of its trade secrets,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that Lopez, Piech and other defendants set up an elaborate operation to copy GM information into VW computers and then shredded the documents.</p>
<p>GM says the Plant X concept, in which outside suppliers take a greater role in vehicle assembly, was used in a new VW plant in Brazil.</p>
<p>Volkswagen has denied the allegations. Attorney Denvir said the company will continue to vigorously defend itself.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very unusual to get rid of a case at this stage,&quot; he said after the ruling. &quot;We would have been very surprised and delighted if we had won.&quot;</p>
<p>In another ruling Wednesday, Edmunds said several VW executives who left GM with Lopez could be included in GM's lawsuit in Detroit. They are: Jorge Alvarez Aguirre, Rosario Piazza, Francisco Garcia-Sanz, Hugo Van Der Auwera, Willibrordus Admiraal, Andries Versteeg, Jairo Wicker, and H. W. Lytle.</p>
<p>Edmunds said she has not yet decided if Piech and Jens Neumann, a member of VW's board of management, should be included as defendants. Also undecided is whether VW's Volkswagen of America unit can be named as a defendant, and if a similar GM lawsuit in Spain should be joined with the U.S. lawsuit. The judge said she will make that decision in a written opinion to be filed before Oct. 28.</p>
<p>Edmunds ruling Wednesday clears the way for another hearing Oct. 28 to determine whether GM's claims of racketeering, copyright infringement and trademark violations should be included in a trial of the case.</p>
<p>GM had difficulty serving the lawsuit to Lopez, who has avoided the United States since he left GM. But GM process servers caught up with him at a VW executive meeting in Vancouver, Canada, in June and served him with the lawsuit as he used a telephone in a hotel lobby.</p>
<p>GM also will ask Edmunds whether it can mail the lawsuit to three of the 11 defendants in the case who have not yet been served -- VW executives Alvarez, Piazza and Versteeg.</p>
<p>VW, subject to continuing criminal investigations in both Germany and the United States, sued GM and its Adam Opel AG unit for defamation in a German court in May, claiming GM made false accusations against VW. A decision in that case is expected Oct. 30.</p>
