<headline>VW says to boost Passat production plan.</headline>
<dateline>WOLFSBURG, Germany 1997-04-10</dateline>

<p>German carmaker Volkswagen AG said on Thursday it had seen unexpectedly strong demand for its new Passat vehicle and would increase the 1997 production schedule by up to 25 percent.</p>
<p>VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech told journalists at a company event late on Wednesday that VW would likely boost Passat production by up to 100,000 units from the planned 300,000, in part due to demand for a new estate wagon version.</p>
<p>The strong demand for the Passat, the top end of VW's product line, was announced as VW said on Thursday it would expand its product range to about 50 models in the next three years from the current level of 38 models.</p>
<p>The carmaker said it would introduce a so-called &quot;three-litre&quot; auto, one that could travel about 100 kilometers on less than three liters of gasoline, by the turn of the century.</p>
<p>&quot;The expansion of our product line is going to accelerate in the coming years,&quot; Piech said in the text of a speech released before VW's annual news conference on Thursday.</p>
<p>Piech defended VW's future goal of using only four vehicle platforms to build cars under the VW, Skoda, Seat and Audi brands, dismissing criticism by some industry observers that there was not enough differentiation between the brands.</p>
<p>The plan calls for VW group brands to use common platforms to build cars. For example, the Audi A4 and VW Passat are built on the same platform as will be the new VW Golf and the existing Audi A3 compact model.</p>
<p>Some industry observers have said cars so far produced on common platforms have been too similar and may &quot;cannibalise&quot; sales within the VW group, a view generally rejected by Piech.</p>
<p>&quot;We remain convinced that the platform strategy that we have developed is still the best way for us to remain competitive,&quot; Piech said, noting the carmaker currently used about 20 different platforms.</p>
<p>Piech, however, did concede that the introduction of the new Passat reduced demand last year for the Audi A4 model more than the carmaker had expected but still led to growth in demand for the two vehicles combined over 1995 levels.</p>
<p>VW has long said the platform strategy would reduce product development times, allow VW to offer more products and simplify production.</p>
