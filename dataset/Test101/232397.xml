<p>Shares in German carmaker Volkswagen AG took a hammering in electronic share trade early on Tuesday, but then rose sharply in bourse trade as investors went bargain-hunting for stock in Europe's largest carmaker.</p>
<p>The share fell three percent to touch 574 marks -- their lowest level since October 11 -- after a U.S. judge denied VW's motion to dismiss General Motor's remaining industrial espionage charges.</p>
<p>However, VW shares then advanced strongly during floor trade and ended bourse trade on Germany's DAX index of blue-chips at 592.50 marks, up 5.50 marks.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the chances to buy the stock at this price will be relatively short -- VW shares are cheap at this level and no-one is going to base their investment strategy on one event,&quot; said Horst Frey, car analyst at ABN Amro in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>One share trader said: &quot;The way the share price has moved today is staggering. Fundamentally the stock is in very good shape. We've been saying that the downside on the share has been overdone looking at the health of the company.&quot;</p>
<p>The trader sounded a note of caution, however.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't seen one buy order at these lower levels today. This means that it probably isn't the institutions boosting the share -- it could be day-to-day buyers snapping it up, who will then sell it on as the share rises,&quot; said the trader.</p>
<p>Market players agreed that the outlook for the share price in the next few days depends on whether or not there is a settlement in the legal dispute between Volkswagen and GM.</p>
<p>&quot;For VW to appoint Javier Garcia Sanz (a co-defendant in the U.S. civil law suit) to the board is a bit like waving a red rag to a bull. The two are preparing to slug it out, so in the meantime we'll get on with looking at the rest of the company,&quot; said a London-based DAX trader.</p>
<p>A trader in Frankfurt said: &quot;Watch the reaction on the share price tomorrow. I believe that GM wants Volkswagen to sizzle a little bit more and will not settle soon.</p>
<p>&quot;But the share price should still be okay as long as people believe that fundamentally the stock is alright. On the other hand, the stock will only continue to thrive as long as no-one can assess the damages that VW will have to pay out,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Other market players were adopting a wait-and-see approach, with one motor analyst saying that the real buying interest will kick in once the stock hits 550 marks.</p>
<p>The strength of the dollar against the mark lifted the exporting sector generally, including other German carmakers, and a portion of Volkswagen's rise could be attributed to a general sectoral boost.</p>
<p>The initial share price drop came following news from the U.S. late on Monday that U.S. District Judge Nancy Edwards allowed GM to pursue claims that Volkswagen and several of its top executives violated copyright, trademark and unfair competition laws in an alleged scheme to steal GM trade secrets.</p>
<p>This cleared the way for the U.S. lawsuit to proceed. A GM spokesman said on Monday that GM had not held settlement talks with VW and was prepared to let the case proceed.</p>
<p>The resignation last Friday of VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, at the centre of the allegations, had fuelled speculation that the two could settle their dispute out of court, which boosted the share slightly.</p>
