<p>Adam Opel's already strained relations with Volkswagen got worse on Tuesday when it demanded VW cut ties with executives linked to allegations of industrial spying before a settlement of a civil suit launched by its parent, General Motors, can be reached.</p>
<p>Opel chief executive David Herman told Reuters in an interview that &quot;an opportunity to move forward&quot; was lost when VW accepted the resignation of VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, but said he might stay on as a consultant.  </p>
<p>Herman said no settlement talks are now being held with VW and that none were scheduled.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no chance right now to go forward,&quot; Herman said.</p>
<p>Opel's conditions for a settlement of the U.S. lawsuit are that Lopez and others must leave VW; a public acknowledgement of error must be issued; and VW must pay damages.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation has gotten worse,&quot; he said. &quot;We do not accept that Lopez directs any actions on behalf of their company from the outside and that all people that we alleged to be in the conspiracy are still working there and making use of our company information.&quot;  </p>
<p>VW spokesman Klaus Kocks declined to comment on Herman's statements, but said VW stood by its commitment to enter any negotiations without any preconditions.</p>
<p>&quot;We have always said that we are ready to talk but without any preconditions,&quot; Kocks said. &quot;Right now, we agree to disagree on the general judgment of what happened. The point is that no damage has been done and there will be no money.&quot;</p>
<p>Opel was incensed that VW ignored its demand for Lopez and at least seven other former GM executives who followed him to Volkswagen in March 1993 to be forced out for allegedly taking along production and purchasing secret document.  </p>
<p>Lopez, who announced his resignation on Friday, will receive about four million marks in compensation and VW management board chairman Ferdinand Peich said he would welcome the chance to keep on working with Lopez as a consultant.</p>
<p>In addition, one of Lopez's protogees and a former GM employee, Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, who is a defendant in the U.S. lawsuit, has been named to replace Lopez.</p>
<p>&quot;That certainly does not satisfy any of the conditions,&quot; Herman said.  </p>
<p>&quot;We believe our claims in the U.S. and Germany have a substantial basis. We will win those cases and it could lead to a substantially high amount of damages.</p>
<p>&quot;What the right amount will be is something that will come out of a full analysis of the facts, including the results of the discovery phase of the lawsuit.&quot;</p>
<p>He reaffirmed that Opel would consider a deal, but talks, which he said have not been held for some time, have failed.</p>
<p>&quot;There has not even been an agreement on the conditions for a settlement, nor discussions at this time,&quot; he said.  </p>
<p>He said one sticking point was getting VW to apologise for statements made by top VW officials at the outset, including allegations by German politicans that the United States wanted to start &quot;an economic war&quot; with Germany and that GM and Opel were doing it.</p>
<p>Herman noted that GM and Opel -- which are the No. 2 carmakers in Europe behind VW -- were aware how far they could push VW in the legal battle without its public image suffering.</p>
<p>&quot;We are conscious of the necessity that, whatever happens, the parties must be able to live and work together in the German community in the future,&quot; Herman said.</p>
<p>Herman also dismissed speculation from industry observers that there was a rift between Opel's German headquarters and top GM executives in Detroit on how to proceed with the case.</p>
<p>&quot;That is preposterous,&quot; he said. &quot;It is not logical and certainly not correct to give the impression that anything we are doing does not represent the studied position of all concerned within our corporation.&quot;</p>
