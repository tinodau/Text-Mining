<headline>Volkswagen's Spanish unit shrugs aside Lopez charges.</headline>

<p>Volkswagen's Spanish unit on Thursday shrugged aside criminal charges against cost-cutting wizard &quot;Superlopez&quot;, the executive at the heart of an industrial espionage row with U.S. giant General Motors.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Sociedad Espanola de Automoviles de Turismo SA (Seat) told Reuters &quot;This matter doesn't affect Seat at all.&quot;</p>
<p>German prosecutors said on Wednesday that former top Volkswagen AG executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua would face criminal charges for allegedly stealing secret documents when he quit General Motors Corp in 1993 to join VW.</p>
<p>The 55-year-old Spaniard remains on Seat's board after recently resigning from VW. The Seat board will hold its first meeting since Lopez's resignation on December 18, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Lopez is expected to soon resign from his position on the Seat board, a Seat union source said.</p>
<p>In addition, he said that the chairman of Seat, Joan Llorens, whose contract with the company expires this month, will not continue in his post.</p>
<p>&quot;They haven't communicated anything with us officially, but from the news that goes out and conversations with Llorens himself one can deduce that he isn't going to continue as president, but that he will occupy a position as a consultant for the company,&quot; the union source said.</p>
<p>There has been talk of Llorens' resignation since this spring and press reports have repeatedly pointed to the Belgian Pierre-Alain de Smedt, currently with Volkswagen do Brasil, as his potential successor.</p>
<p>The Seat spokesman gave no comment, except to say that Finance Chief Utz Claasen has presented his official resignation and is moving to a different company in Germany.</p>
<p>The spokesman said that very few of Lopez's aides remain at Seat. One of his close associates, Jorge Alvarez, former Seat vice president of sales, left this position one year ago and is now working at Volkswagen Coaching.</p>
<p>Another close colleague of Lopez's and his successor as purchasing manager at Volkswagen Franciso Garcia Sanz, is currently a member of Seat's board.</p>
<p>Seat employee Rosario Piazza, who forms part of Lopez's closest aides, does not hold an executive position at the group.</p>
<p>GM said on Wednesday that it had filed charges against a former VW executive, Jose Manuel Gutierrez, and Piazza and Alvarez.</p>
<p>All of this news coincides with a decisive new era for Seat.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, VW president Ferdinand Piech reiterated on German television that Seat's objective was to generate earnings in 1997 without any outside help.</p>
<p>In 1996 Seat expects earnings of three billion pesetas thanks to support from the parent company.</p>
<p>Next year, Seat wants to raise its production by 12 percent to 465,000 cars in an effort to put an end to the restructuing process begun in 1993 with losses of 151 billion pesetas ($1.16 billion).</p>
