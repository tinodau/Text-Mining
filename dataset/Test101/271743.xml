<p>The Egyptian military prosecutor will handle the case against an Egyptian arrested on suspicion of spying for Israel, security sources said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;The military prosecution has received the papers of Samir Osman's case,&quot; a source told Reuters.</p>
<p>Osman, 47, was arrested last month on suspicion of selling military information to Mossad, the Israeli secret service.</p>
<p>According to details given then by the government newspaper al-Ahram, Osman met Mossad agents in Greece, Turkey and Hungary or by swimming to Israel underwater with scuba diving equipment from the border resort of Taba. Osman was a diver during his service at the naval forces.</p>
<p>Osman was said to have confessed to providing Mossad with information about the Egyptian navy and about the place where he served in the Egyptian military.</p>
<p>&quot;The military prosecution will review Osman's file to issue the charge sheet detailing accusations against him,&quot; the security source said.</p>
<p>Osman's case is not linked to that of Israeli textile engineer Azam Azam, who was arrested on November 5 on suspicion of spying on Egypt for his country. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he was pressing Egypt to release Azam.</p>
<p>The security source said the official charge sheet detailing accusations against Azam and his alleged partners likely would be made public in the next few days.</p>
