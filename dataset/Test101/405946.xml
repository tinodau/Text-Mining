<headline>VW says bribery probe data not yet clear.</headline>
<dateline>WOLFSBURG, Germany 1997-02-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>Volkswagen AG said on Wednesday it did not yet have sufficient information to conclude whether allegations of corruption and bribery at the German carmaker had any foundation.</p>
<p>VW said it would keep up its internal investigation into the allegations as well as cooperate with German prosecutors who have so far identified two people as being involved in demanding and receiving bribes in exchange for VW contracts.</p>
<p>The carmaker on Monday turned over the findings of its internal investigation to prosecutors probing allegations that VW workers demanded about 20 million marks ($12 million) in kickbacks from Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB for a 400 million mark plant expansion contract for VW's Czech Skoda unit.</p>
<p>&quot;Volkswagen will strongly investigate all of the corruption allegations through its own probe and by involving the public prosecutors,&quot; VW said in a statement.</p>
<p>VW had said at the weekend it would issue the statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The carmaker again called on all suppliers to report any irregularities in dealings with the company and said that legal charges would be brought against any VW employee violating German laws in order to preserve supplier relationships.</p>
<p>As part of the internal investigation, VW has so far suspended one employee and fired another worker who was then put in investigative custody by prosecutors in Braunschweig.</p>
