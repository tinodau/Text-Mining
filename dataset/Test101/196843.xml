<p>The U.S. government on Monday charged a veteran CIA officer with spying for Russia over the last two years, alleging he was photographing secret documents to sell to Moscow just six days ago.</p>
<p>The suspect, Harold Nicholson, an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency for 16 years who held posts abroad and most recently worked in counter-terrorism, was accused of spying for Russia since June, 1994, in exchange for more than $100,000.</p>
<p>&quot;He was not motivated by ideology but by greed,&quot; the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Helen Fahey, who is in overall charge of prosecuting the case, told reporters.</p>
<p>It was the first such case in the United States since the 1994 arrest of confessed CIA turncoat Aldrich Ames. Fahey said the Nicholson case was not related to Ames, who is now serving a life sentence.</p>
<p>Nicholson faced a possible death sentence if any secrets he sold led to deaths or involved highly classified military matters, but Fahey said there was no such evidence yet.</p>
<p>According to the charges, Nicholson, who had special clearance for access to highly sensitive information, photographed top-secret CIA documents about Russia just six days ago with the intent to deliver them to a Russian intelligence officer.</p>
<p>In an affidavit, FBI agent Michael Lonergan charged that Nicholson &quot;has been acting clandestinely, corruptly and illegally as an agent of the Russian Federation foreign intelligence service.&quot;</p>
<p>Nicholson was taken into custody last Saturday at Dulles Airport as he was about to fly to Switzerland to meet his Russian handlers, Raymond Mislock, the agent in charge of the FBI's national security division, told reporters.</p>
<p>He described Nicholson as having been unaware he was under suspicion. &quot;He was completely suprised&quot; when arrested, Mislock said, adding that Nicholson so far had given no information to the  authorities about his alleged spying.</p>
<p>Court papers alleged that Nicholson had made $120,000 in unexplained bank deposits following trips abroad.</p>
<p>Nicholson, who turned 46 on Sunday, had access to some of the nation's most sensitive intelligence secrets. He had been employed as an operations officer in various posts around the world and worked as an instructor at a classified CIA special training centre between 1994 and 1996.</p>
<p>He appeared for about two minutes in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, just across the Potomac River from Washington, on early Monday.</p>
<p>The CIA and the FBI have been hunting for a second possible Moscow spy inside the CIA since the Feb. 21, 1994, arrest of Ames, who was found guilty of selling some of the most sensitive U.S. secrets to Moscow over a 10-year period.</p>
<p>A U.S. official said the damage done appeared to be nowhere &quot;near the magnitude&quot; caused by Ames, who unmasked about three dozen agents and perhaps hundreds of operations.</p>
<p>&quot;Any time you have a spy in your midst, it's bad news,&quot; the official said. &quot;The good news is that he was caught, and he was caught quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>John Deutch, the director of central intelligence, and Louis Freeh, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, were to hold a joint news conference to report on the Nicholson case at 1 p.m. EST (1800 GMT) at FBI headquarters.</p>
<p>As a result of the Ames case, the CIA tightened security and counter-spy defences, requiring stepped-up financial disclosures from its employees among other things.</p>
<p>In addition, Congress rewrote the law so that the CIA must immediately inform the FBI, which has the lead responsiblity for spy-catching in the U.S. government, when it suspects any loss of classified information.</p>
<p>These post-Ames reforms played a &quot;major role in wrapping up this case rapidly,&quot; a U.S. official said.</p>
<p>The arrest of Ames, a 31-year career officer, set in motion changes in the U.S. intelligence community that have yet to run their course. James Woolsey resigned as CIA director in December 1994 after being sharply criticised in Congress over the handling of the Ames affair.</p>
