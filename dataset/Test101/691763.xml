<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended Friday.</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE 100 index closed lower but off the day's worst levels and with a net gain of 46.4 points on the week. The FTSE 100 closed at 4,640.3, down 17.6 points, or 0.38 percent.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Shares flagged, ending slightly lower after a week that saw the market set fresh records on the back of a liquidity upsurge, despite alarming see-sawing on Wall Street. The DAX-30 index closed at 3,795.41, down 9.88 points, for a rise of 7.14 on the week.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 share index ended a touch weaker, retracing most of the day's losses, and clinging just below the key 2,900 level. The CAC-40 index closed at 2,891.04, down 2.60 points. For the week it rose 133.94 points.</p>

<p>TOKYO - Stocks closed lower after a brief rally prompted by stronger-than-expected growth in Japan's industrial production in May fizzled out due to caution on the peak day for annual shareholders' meetings, brokers said.

<p>JOHANNESBURG - Industrial and all-share indices finished at record highs but the gold index tumbled to its lowest since March 1993.
