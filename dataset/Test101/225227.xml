<p>The dispute over Volkswagen's hiring of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua from General Motors has been going on for nearly four years now.</p>

<p>* APRIL 1993 -- Opel initiates legal proceedings against Lopez at a court in Darmstadt, alleging industrial espionage to the detriment of Opel and GM.</p>
<p>* MAY 1993 -- Opel tries to issue an employment ban at the regional court in Frankfurt, stopping seven of Lopez' colleagues from taking jobs at VW. The court denies the application, saying there was no legal basis for it.</p>
<p>* JULY 1993 -- The Darmstadt prosecutor's office widens the scope of its investigations into Lopez and his colleagues. Investigators from the state prosecutors office discover confidential documents from Opel and GM in the Wiesbaden apartment of two former Opel managers.</p>
<p>* JULY 1993 -- Prosecutors in Detroit begin investigations against Lopez and his colleagues. Speaking in an interview with Germany's Stern magazine, VW management board Chairman Ferdinand Piech describes the Lopez affair as &quot;international economic war&quot; against his company.</p>

<p>* MAY 1996 -- VW initiates proceedings of its own at the regional court in Frankfurt for damages to its reputation against GM and Opel.</p>
<p>* JUNE 1996 -- Provincial high court in Celle requires that VW defend the U.S. action by GM and Opel.</p>
<p>* JULY 1996 -- VW contests GM's damages claim in the U.S.</p>
<p>* OCTOBER 1996 -- Regional court in Frankfurt rejects VW's claims of damage to its reputation. In Detroit, a federal judge turns down VW's request to dismiss GM's civil suit and rules that top VW executives should remain defendants.</p>
<p>* NOVEMBER 1996</p>
<p>Nov. 8 -- Legal sources say indictment against Lopez would come in 1996.</p>
