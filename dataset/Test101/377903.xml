<p>Up to 35 people were feared drowned on Friday after a boat powered by an outboard motor capsized in Lake Victoria, leaving survivors clinging to hunks of wood, jerrycans and baskets of fish.</p>
<p>Police spokesman Peter Kimanthi said only four bodies were recovered from Africas largest lake on Wednesday and there were five survivors. But he had no confirmed death toll.</p>
<p>He said it remained unclear how many passengers were on board but police suspected the boat had been overloaded. Kenyan newspapers put the number of dead from the capsize at about 35.</p>
<p>&quot;The 35 perished in the deep waters of the lake during high tides...The dead included the boats owner and three members of his family,&quot; said the Kenya Times newspaper, owned by Kenyas ruling party.</p>
<p>Survivors clung to pieces of wood, jerrycans and baskets loaded with fish after the boat, powered by an outboard engine, capsized about 40 km (25 miles) from the western Kenyan port of Homa Bay.</p>
<p>The boat was loaded with bags of maize and sugar, Kimanthi said.</p>
<p>He said the boat was used as a passenger vessel on the lake and had left its first port on Wednesday with 35 passengers. But police suspected the vessel had picked up other passengers at three towns it called in at before sinking.</p>
<p>The Kenya Times quoted a port official at Homa Bay as saying the boat, the Owila, picked up more people and more cargo at its second stop. Officials appealed to the Kenyan navy to help in rescue work.</p>
<p>More than 600 people were killed in May last year in the worst shipping disaster on Lake Victoria when the Tanzanian -owned ferry Bukoba capsized and sank in 27 metres (90 feet) of water.</p>
<p>A total of 403 bodies were recovered but survivors said the ferry was grossly overloaded with more than 1,000 people aboard.</p>
<p>A government inquiry blamed the ships owners, the state -owned Tanzania Railways Corporation, for operating an unstable ship and said its marine operations were characterised by gross negligence, inefficiency, corruption and other malpractices.</p>
<p>Disasters involving overloaded boats are common on the lake, covering 70,000 square km (27,000 square miles) from Uganda in the north to Tanzania in the south and Kenya in the east.</p>
