<p>German carmaker Volkswagen AG suffered another legal blow on Wednesday in its fight against rival Adam Opel AG when a judge dismissed its lawsuit charging the unit of U.S. carmaker General Motors Corp with defamation.</p>
<p>VW immediately said it would appeal the decision to a higher German court in the latest twist in a protracted legal battle in the U.S. and Germany over allegations that some top GM officials left the carmaker for VW with secret documents.</p>
<p>&quot;We will appeal,&quot; VW spokesman Klaus Kocks told Reuters.</p>
<p>VW, Europe's largest carmaker, had sought 10 million marks ($6.6 million) in damages over statements made by Opel and General Motors at news conferences last March to announce they had filed a lawsuit against VW over alleged industrial espionage.</p>
<p>The two carmakers have been bitterly squaring off in a series of legal battles in the U.S. and Germany since Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua left GM to join Volkswagen as head of production and procurement in 1993.</p>
<p>GM alleges in its U.S. lawsuit that Lopez and several other former top GM executives, who joined VW with him, stole industrial secrets.</p>
<p>VW has vehemently denied the charges.</p>
<p>VW said in Frankfurt court hearing this month that GM and Opel had sought to prejudice public opinion at company news conferences by portraying the Wolfsburg-based carmaker as a criminal organisation.</p>
<p>The Opel and GM officials accused VW and its top officials, including VW chief Ferdinand Piech, of conspiracy, misappropriation of trade secrets and racketeering.</p>
<p>Frankfurt Judge Guenther Kinnel said in the written ruling issued on Wednesday that GM and Opel's statements were covered under freedom of speech laws and that Opel officials had only expressed their opinions about their U.S. lawsuit against VW.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Opel hailed the latest court victory, saying the Frankfurt lawsuit had been a nuisance and that the focus would not shift to the Detroit proceedings.</p>
<p>&quot;We had expected this decision,&quot; said Peter Heckel, an attorney representing Opel. &quot;Freedom of speech is very important under German law.&quot;</p>
<p>VW also suffered a setback earlier this month when a U.S. federal court allowed General Motors to proceed with its action against VW in Detroit, the capital of the U.S. car industry.</p>
<p>The next hearing in the Detroit court case has been set for December 3 and an Opel official said he expected the exchange of evidence in the case to begin by year-end. A trial date could be set for as early as next summer, he said.</p>
<p>The U.S. lawsuit alleges that Lopez, Piech and other defendants set up an elaborate operation to copy GM information into VW computers and then shredded the documents.</p>
<p>GM says its Plant X concept, in which outside suppliers take a greater role in vehicle assembly, was used in a new VW plant in Brazil.</p>
<p>VW has gone to great lengths to fight the lawsuit in the U.S., a country with more liberal laws on seeking evidence, and protecting its executives from being officially served with GM's lawsuit.</p>
<p>After unsuccessful attempts in Germany to serve VW executives with the suit, officials found Lopez and Piech during a June meeting of top VW executives in Canada.</p>
<p>Lopez was served in the lobby of a Vancouver hotel as he used a telephone and Piech as he left a cocktail party.</p>
<p>U.S. court documents said process servers alleged that they were physically harassed by VW security guards, including one who said he was grabbed around the neck by one guard.</p>
