<headline>Opel dismisses talk it in VW deal.</headline>

<p>German carmaker Opel AG on Wednesday said it was not at the moment in talks with rival Volkswagen AG to reach an out-of-court deal on a U.S. civil court lawsuit Opel has filed against the carmaker alleging it had stolen industrial secrets.</p>
<p>&quot;There are at the moment no settlement discussions between Opel (and parent company General Motors Corp) and Volkswagen,&quot; Opel said in a statement.</p>
<p>Opel made the announcement after Germany's Spiegel magazine said at the weekend that the carmakers were in secret talks to settle the lawsuit linked to the transfer of former GM production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua in March 1993 to Volkswagen.</p>
<p>The carmaker said it was not its policy to comment on the status of confidential settlement negotiations but said it felt required to do so &quot;to correct misleading information that has been disseminated to the public, as in this case&quot;.</p>
<p>A Volkswagen spokesman was not immediately available for comment but a company official said a news statement was expected to be released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>GM won a major court victory on Tuesday when a U.S. judge in Detroit allowed the carmaker to pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and some top VW executives, including VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech, over the documents.</p>
<p>Opel reaffirmed that any talks on a deal to settle the lawsuit would require Lopez to be fired from VW, payment for damages and a public explanation and apology.</p>
<p>&quot;Volkswagen management has not acceded to these fundamental and equitable bases for an honorable and fair resolution of this matter,&quot; Opel said.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than take these necessary steps, Volkswagen management has continued to deny any wrongdoing and has supported Lopez by retaining him as a senior member of management,&quot; Opel said in the statement.</p>
<p>GM and Opel said in the statement that they would keep up their legal fight against Volkswagen in both the United States and Germany and would cooperate with prosecutors who are reviewing criminal charges against VW and Lopez.</p>
