<p>Lawyers for alleged Israeli spy Azam Azam asked a Cairo court on Tuesday to seek more opinions on one of the key pieces of evidence -- women's underwear the prosecution says were impregnated with secret ink.</p>
<p>Lawyer Farid el-Deeb said he wanted the Justice Ministry's forensic science department to see if scientific institutions in Cairo had the equipment to test for the ink.</p>
<p>The request was a challenge to the prosecution's reliance on a government chemist who spent 90 minutes on Tuesday in closed-door deliberations with the judge and the lawyers for Azam, a textile engineer arrested in Cairo last year.</p>
<p>Azam, an Israeli Druze, and his alleged Egyptian accomplice, Emad Abdelhalim Ismail, face charges of making a criminal arrangement to spy in Egypt for the Israeli secret service Mossad. The trial began on April 24.</p>
<p>The prosecution protested against Deeb's request, saying the chemist was entirely competent. But Deeb later told reporters: &quot;The court has yet to decide on the matter (the request).&quot;</p>
<p>The charge sheet says that Azam gave women's underwear inscribed with invisible ink from Mossad to Ismail.</p>
<p>The other defendants in the case are Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna, who are not in Egypt. Like Azam, they belong to Israel's Druze community.</p>
<p>All four defendants are charged with making a criminal agreement to spy for Mossad against Egypt.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have said at the trial that Greiss gave Ismail $650 when he was recruited and Shawahna offered to pay him $1,000 a month if he helped Mossad.</p>
<p>They said Ismail agreed to help the two women spy for Mossad when he went to Israel in 1996 to train at a women's garment factory.</p>
<p>Azam's trial has brought Egyptian-Israeli relations to one of their lowest points since the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979.</p>
<p>Asaad Asaad, a prominent Druze figure and an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and members of the Israeli embassy in Cairo attended Tuesday's session.</p>
<p>It is not clear what the maximum penalty for the charges is.</p>
<p>Azam's lawyer, Deeb, has said his client faces a maximum 15 years in prison with hard labour while Ismail, who had worked as a teacher in a state-run school, could be given a life sentence because he was a civil servant.</p>
<p>Ahmed Bakr, Ismail's lawyer, said both men faced a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.</p>
