<p>German automaker Volkswagen's debt ratings were reaffirmed by Standard &amp; Poor's on Tuesday but the credit agency said it had not factored in the company's running legal battle with U.S. rival General Motors Corp.</p>
<p>&quot;With respect to the ongoing litigation between General Motors and Volkswagen, the potential exists for a significant monetary settlement or court judgment which could impact existing ratings,&quot; S&amp;P said in a statement.</p>
<p>But it added the likelihood, amount and timing of either a settlement or a decision on damages could not be assessed yet, and the ratings made no assumption about the pending litigation.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said Volkswagen's ratings continued to reflect its position as the leading European automotive volume manufacturer and the strength of its financial profile.</p>
<p>&quot;In the face of an increasingly competitive marketplace and with profitability impacted by high German labour costs, Volkswagen continues to take steps to improve its competitive position,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>S&amp;P affirmed the A plus corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings and the A1 commercial paper rating of Volkswagen AG and related entities. Its rating outlook on VW was stable.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said it was confident the effectiveness of cost cutting measures and results of future model programmes will support the sustainability of Volkswagen's current ratings, but questions existed over potential litigation-related pay-outs.</p>
<p>VW has been in a nearly four-year legal battle with GM over the transfer of a top GM production executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.</p>
<p>On Monday, VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech said he regretted the trouble and costs suffered by GM over the 1993 transfer of Lopez.</p>
<p>But Piech also said the transfer was &quot;fully legal&quot; and he did not comment directly on allegations that Lopez and seven other former GM associates stole secret documents when the quit GM.</p>
