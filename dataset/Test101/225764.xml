<title>SWITZERLAND: VW compromise offer did not go far enough - sources.</title>
<headline>VW compromise offer did not go far enough - sources.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1996-11-29</dateline>

<p>General Motors did not accept Volkswagen AG's proposals during discussions on a possible out-of-court settlement as it thought the VW offer was not comprehensive enough, a source at carmaker Opel said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The offer VW made missed the point so completely that it made discussions on an out-of-court agreement impossible,&quot; the source said.</p>
<p>There were no discussions on resolving the three-year legal dispute at the moment, the source said.</p>
<p>Opel never left any doubt that it was ready for discussions, the source said.</p>
<p>However, the source went on to say that comments from VW about an agreement, which helped the VW share price, meant that Opel was forced to come out with a declaration of principle and set out conditions for an agreement.</p>
<p>Opel, the German unit of GM, said earlier on Friday that the resignation of Volkswagen production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez could not compensate for damages incurred by GM.</p>
<p>It was now a question of establishing the amount of damages, a public apology and a public acceptance of responsibility and the removal of Lopez's seven colleagues, who left with Lopez to move to Volkswagen, the source said.</p>
<p>&quot;The scapegoat Lopez has no longer any role to play in the game given the current amount of legal pressure,&quot; said the source.</p>
