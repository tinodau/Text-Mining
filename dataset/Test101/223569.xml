<headline>German DAX index ends bourse trade at record close.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-11-28</dateline>

<p>Germany's DAX index of 30 top shares ended bourse trade on Thursday at a record closing high, after the dollar raced up to its highest level for a month against the mark, boosting German exporting stocks.</p>
<p>The DAX index closed at 2,817.49 points, up 0.73 percent, or 20.46 points, just below its all-time intraday record high of 2,819.95 points reached on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The dollar penetrated the crucial 1.53 mark level, after the Bank of France monetary policy council member Jean-Pierre Gerard said he favoured a stronger dollar against the mark, particularly benefiting Germany's export-oriented chemicals and auto sectors.</p>
<p>But dealers said volumes were somewhat dampened due to the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S..</p>
<p>Shares in Europe's biggest carmaker Volkswagen AG continued to be at the centre of attention and recovered two percent, closing bourse dealings up 11.70 marks at 613 marks.</p>
<p>The stock had fallen six percent on Wednesday after a U.S. judge ruling that could open VW to potentially much higher damages in a lawsuit with Opel, a subsidiary of U.S. carmaker General Motors.</p>
<p>On Thursday, sources close to the company said production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, at the centre of alleged industrial espionage charges, was likely to offer his resignation on Friday.</p>
<p>Opel has demanded that VW should sack Lopez, apologise, and offer compensation in return for an out-of-court settlement in a U.S. civil lawsuit filed by Opel and GM earlier this year.</p>
<p>Dealers said if no settlement was reached in the next few days then VW shares could slip below the 600 mark level.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, shares in national airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG ended up 12 pfennigs at 19.87 marks. The shares had temporarily dipped after the company reported a decline in pre-tax profits for the first nine months of the year, but later recovered.</p>
