<headline>VW lawyers expect Lopez charges soon, paper says.</headline>

<p>Lawyers for Volkswagen AG expect German prosecutors to file charges this month against four of its top executives for alleged industrial espionage following a three-year investigation, a newspaper reported Friday.</p>
<p>Munich-based Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported that VW's lawyers expect production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a former executive of General Motors Corp., and three others to face charges for allegedly taking secret information with them when they left GM subsidiary Opel in 1993.</p>
<p>The three other executives -- identified as Jose Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez and Rosario Piazza -- left Opel when Lopez defected to Volkswagen and joined its management board.</p>
<p>Lopez, a Basque, has been renowned for his ability to streamline production and cut costs, setting about innovative work practices at VW, Europe's largest carmaker, that have helped it to return to profitability.</p>
<p>VW, which has consistently denied the allegations, declined comment on the report but said that Lopez would stay with the company even if he were to face criminal charges.</p>
<p>Volkswagen also referred calls to its Frankfurt lawyer, who was not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt state prosecutors' office declined to confirm the newspaper report but a spokeswoman said a decision on whether to charge Lopez would be made by the end of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not commenting on whether a decision has already been taken to bring charges or to terminate proceedings,&quot; Hildegard Becker-Toussaint, the office's spokeswoman, said in response to a quiry.</p>
<p>Before a decision was made public, the parties involved would have to be informed by the Darmstadt public prosecutors' office, which is leading the probe, she added.</p>
<p>In a bitter three-year legal dispute, GM and Opel have alleged that Lopez and seven other former GM managers stole secrets on purchasing and production plans when they moved to VW.</p>
<p>GM and Opel have also filed a lawsuit in Detroit against VW and its top executives, including Lopez and VW Management Board Chairman Ferdinand Piech, due to frustration at the pace of the German criminal investigation.</p>
<p>GM first filed a legal complaint against Lopez and another former GM manager a month after Lopez's defection, but the company later suspended the action.</p>
