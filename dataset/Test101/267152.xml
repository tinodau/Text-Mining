<p>U.S. investigators on Thursday tried to assess the full extent of the damage caused by a veteran FBI agent accused of selling national security secrets to Russian intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>FBI Director Louis Freeh, responding to questions at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, said the damage assessment was incomplete involving Earl Edwin Pitts, a 13-year agent who faces espionage charges.</p>
<p>&quot;I would not underestimate the seriousness of the damage,&quot; Freeh said.</p>
<p>Pitts, 43, whose alleged espionage began while he worked in the New York FBI unit responsible for catching Russian spies, was charged with passing along &quot;everything&quot; he could to Moscow from 1987 to 1992, for more than $224,000.</p>
<p>Freeh said Russian intelligence had escalated its efforts to spy on the United States, especially in economic espionage.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that (Russian) aggression has been unabated even in the post-Cold War. It's escalating. It's a serious problem. It's a continuing problem,&quot; said Freeh, whose agency is responsible for catching spies in the United States.</p>
<p>Freeh said at least 23 foreign intelligence services were targeting the United States and its economic infrastructure.</p>
<p>But he said U.S. counter-intelligence efforts had improved, which might be one reason why spies in the CIA and FBI have been uncovered.</p>
<p>The arrest of Pitts on Wednesday came exactly a month after agents took into custody Harold Nicholson, the highest-ranking CIA official to be charged with spying for Russia.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher said money appeared to be the main motive behind the recent spy cases.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a sad and tragic event to see these Americans who are selling out their country for financial gain. That seems to be the motivating factor in this new era ... selling out your country for just a pittance,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Attorney General Janet Reno vowed at her weekly Justice Department news briefing to conduct a thorough review of the Pitts case to determine whether further steps must be taken.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now going to go back and review everything -- matters that we couldn't review while the investigation was ongoing because it was covert, and see if there is anything else that we can learn from all that we find,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The FBI said the arrest of Pitts capped a 16-month undercover operation, with U.S. agents posing as Russian spies and the use of a former Russian official at the United Nations in New York who later became an FBI informant.</p>
<p>Sen. Arlen Specter, the chairman of the intelligence committee, said he believed Pitts caused considerable damage. &quot;But the full extent of the damage won't be known for some time,&quot; the Pennsylvania Republican said.</p>
<p>Specter told NBC's &quot;Today&quot; programme he was satisfied with the security checks the U.S. government had in place while it pursued Pitts.</p>
<p>FBI officials have described it as the most serious spy case since Aldrich Ames, a confessed CIA turncoat arrested in 1994 for betraying numerous agents and passing along some of the nation's most sensitive secrets.</p>
<p>&quot;The FBI and the CIA both are very sensitive now to spies. After the Aldrich Ames case, a great deal is being done that wasn't being done before,&quot; said Specter. &quot;They're working very hard.&quot;</p>
