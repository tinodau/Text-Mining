<p>A German newspaper said on Thursday that Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp have agreed to a settlement regarding GM's allegations of industrial spying by the German carmaker.</p>
<p>Germany's Handelsblatt newspaper released ahead of publication on Friday an article saying that VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen and GM executive committee chairman John Smale had agreed to the settlement to end the dispute over the transfer of Jose Ignacio Lopez to VW from GM in 1993.</p>
<p>GM, which is based in Detroit, charged in its U.S. lawsuit against VW that Lopez stole thousands of secret documents when he left to join VW and used the information to cut more than one billion marks in costs and help VW return to profitability.</p>
<p>The newspaper, quoting U.S. legal sources, as saying that VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech was also in Detroit last week but made no public appearances during the North American automobile show.</p>
<p>Handelsblatt said the settlement calls for VW to buy car parts from GM companies' under long-term contracts and to pay for GM's legal costs from the nearly four-year legal battle.</p>
<p>GM has also dropped its demand that Piech publicly apologise to the U.S. carmaker for the damages incurred by the information taken by Lopez, who faces German criminal charges for allegedly taking along the documents, Handelsblatt said.</p>
