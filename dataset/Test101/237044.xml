<title>EGYPT: Egypt to charge Israeli-Arab women in spy case.</title>
<headline>Egypt to charge Israeli-Arab women in spy case.</headline>

<p>Egyptian state security prosecutors will charge two Israeli-Arab women in connection with the case of an Israeli and an Egyptian suspected of spying for the Jewish state, state security sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The sources named the two female Israeli nationals as Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna and said they were not in Egypt and so would be charged in absentia.</p>
<p>They were accused of recruiting Egyptian national Emad Eddin Abdel Hamid to spy for Israel's intelligence service Mossad, the sources added.</p>
<p>Officials at the Israeli embassy in Cairo were not available for comment.</p>
<p>Azam Azam, an Israeli of Arab origin, is also implicated in the case. The sources said Egyptian state security would issue an official charge sheet detailing accusations against the two men and two women on Saturday.</p>
<p>Azam, 35, chief mechanic at an Israeli-owned textile factory in Egypt, was arrested in Cairo in November by security authorities along with Hamid.</p>
<p>Egyptian security sources have said Hamid confessed to spying for Israel and receiving espionage equipment.</p>
<p>Israel has insisted Azam, of Arab origin, was innocent and demanded his release.</p>
<p>Egypt in 1979 became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel but ties have cooled sharply since right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June.</p>
