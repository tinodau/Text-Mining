<p>At least 50 people were feared drowned when a ferry capsized in Bangladesh in what one policeman described as a &quot;fierce whirlpool&quot;, the official BSS news agency said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The ferry, carrying some 250 passengers, overturned in strong currents on the Dhanu river northeast of Dhaka on Friday. About 200 people swam ashore but the rest were missing, the agency said.</p>
<p>Rescuers recovered the body of a boy on Friday night, it said, but gave no details.</p>
<p>Police said on Saturday evening that fire brigade divers had been searching for more bodies but without success.</p>
<p>&quot;The ferry sank in a fierce whirlpool...and rescuers are having serious difficulty. They have not been able to locate the sunken vessel or recover any victims,&quot; one police officer told reporters.</p>
<p>He said the water was some 200 feet (65 metres) deep where the ferry went down and the bodies had perhaps been swept far downstream.</p>
