<headline>German shares continue rebound, Hoechst surges.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-12-10</dateline>

<p>A reassuring overnight rebound on Wall Street, steady Bunds and a stable dollar helped the German share market post further gains on Tuesday, with many dealers expecting the trend to continue.</p>
<p>Chemicals and drugs giant Hoechst was the main highlight, reaching new highs after it said it would merge its specialty chemicals unit with Swiss group Clariant AG in a deal designed dramatically to save costs in the underperforming sector.</p>
<p>The wider 30-share DAX index ended bourse trade up 33.76 points, 1.18 percent, at 2,891.00 points, a level held by the IBIS index of electronic trade later on in the day.</p>
<p>The gain meant that the index was back close to the levels it had reached before Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan sent global markets tumbling on Friday with his warnings against excessive market exuberance.</p>
<p>Dealers said they thought the DAX could now mount the crucial 2,900 point-level soon. &quot;The market factors are all there,&quot; said one Frankfurt dealer. &quot;I think we are back on track.&quot;</p>
<p>Although some dealers said there was still a lot of nervousness in the market, a move past the 2,900 level, which the DAX had reached for the first time last week, should trigger renewed buying interest.</p>
<p>&quot;If we hit 2,900 points, then we will be chasing 3,000,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>Hoechst ended bourse trade up 2.22 points or three percent at 70.90 as analysts welcomed potential cost savings of 600 million marks coming from the deal, which will result in around 5,000 lost jobs.</p>
<p>Shares in other chemicals stocks also rose after the news, BASF AG ending bourse trade up 2.4 percent, or 1.48 marks at 62.18 marks, while Bayer also climbed 2.4 percent or 1.50 marks to 64.55 marks.</p>
<p>The ongoing feud between German carmaker Volkswagen AG and U.S. rival General Motors Corp was continuing to attract attention.</p>
<p>VW ended bourse dealings up nine marks at 612 after its chief executive Ferdinand Piech appeared to take a more conciliatory line by expressing regret over the cost and trouble caused to both sides by the feud.</p>
<p>VW has been embroiled in a battle with GM over alleged industrial espionage by Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, once a top level GM executive who transferred to VW in 1993. Lopez resigned from VW in late November.</p>
<p>Shares in German truck and machinery manufacturer MAN AG slumped 12 marks to 360 in late IBIS trade after it said it could cut its dividend if its 1996/97 business performance demanded it.</p>
