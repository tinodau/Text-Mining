<p>Volkswagen AG chief executive Ferdinand Piech said he will not directly apologise to General Motors over allegations VW obtained GM secrets when it hired a top GM manager.</p>
<p>On Monday, he said he had the &quot;deepest regrets&quot; for the events surrounding VW's bitter dispute with GM over the transfer of former GM production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua to VW in March 1993.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not expect to have to apologise to General Motors,&quot; Piech said late on Monday at a VW event in Colmar, France.</p>
<p>On Tuesday he told Germany's n-tv network &quot;I do not expect they will wring it (an apology) out of me.&quot;</p>
<p>Piech also said a new round of talks with GM could begin by year-end and that other companies were acting as intermediaries to help bring to an end the fight that some car industry officials have said could endanger German-U.S. trade relations.</p>
<p>But he stopped well short of expressing any wrongdoing by VW - a demand set by GM before it would consider any out-of-court settlement to its U.S. lawsuit that charges VW and top officials with racketeering.</p>
<p>Piech said he hoped a deal could soon be reached with GM and that he wanted a new round of talks to begin after a third attempt in London in September failed.</p>
<p>But Piech added fuel to the battle, telling Germany's Stern magazine in an interview this week that &quot;we have at the moment the better cars and General Motors the better lawyers.&quot;</p>
<p>He also warned GM to expect a lengthy legal fight, one that &quot;in the end will have no winners&quot; and may cost GM more in Germany than it would VW in the U.S. since GM has a stronger presence in Europe than VW does in North America.</p>
<p>Piech also told Stern he knew GM wanted him out at VW, saying, &quot;I have said to my supervisory board from the beginning that this does not involve Lopez but instead really me.&quot;</p>
<p>GM has long demanded that VW apologise before it would consider any settlement to its U.S. lawsuit, which is based on racketeering laws first used to fight the mafia and could leave VW facing a jury verdict in the billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Other demands set out by GM include that VW sever all ties with GM and that VW agree to pay for damages. Lopez resigned from the VW management board on November 29 but GM officials were incensed that VW appointed a Lopez protogee to the job.</p>
<p>The Detroit carmaker contends Lopez used the data from GM to cut VW's costs by about 700 million marks, quickly eroding a 20 percent cost advantage that its German unit Opel had over VW, considered the largest carmaker in Europe.</p>
<p>Piech made his comment of regret ahead of a Stern magazine report on Tuesday saying VW has asked Mercedes-Benz chief executive Helmut Werner to help end the legal battle.</p>
<p>Stern said Werner was an intermediary to help settle the lawsuit in which Piech and other VW executives are defendants.</p>
<p>A Mercedes-Benz spokesman denied the report, saying &quot;Werner is not an intermediary between Volkswagen and GM.&quot;</p>
<p>Werner, who is rumoured to be on the verge of leaving Mercedes, is being viewed as a potential successor to follow Ferdinand Piech as VW chief executive, industry sources say.</p>
<p>The VW supervisory board has also given Piech, the grandson of VW founder Ferdinand Porsche, until year-end to settle the lawsuit or he could risk not having his contract renewed when it expires next year, Stern added.</p>
<p>A VW spokesman declined comment on the report.</p>
<p>Piech also told journalists in Colmar that General Electric chairman Jack Welch was one of the business leaders helping to bring about an end to the dispute.</p>
<p>Also on Tuesday, sources said German prosecutors later this week will file lesser-than-expected criminal charges involving embezzlement and betrayal against Lopez and some of the colleagues who followed had him from GM to VW.</p>
<p>But the sources said the charges would not include more serious allegations involving fraud that can carry a jail term of five to 10 years.</p>
<p>The expected charges against Lopez are punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine, but first-time offenders do not usually face prison time, according to legal experts.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Lopez's lawyer declined comment.</p>
