<p>The works council of Adam Opel AG demanded on Tuesday that the German carmaker make clear its position on possible job cuts as another top executive quit over parent General Motor Corp's global expansion plan.</p>
<p>The Opel works council said recent German media reports saying the carmaker may cut up to 10,000 jobs has created a &quot;storm of controversy&quot; that has caused heightened tensions among the carmaker's 45,000 workers in Germany.</p>
<p>The leader of Opel's works council, Rudolf Mueller, said no new new labour contract would be approved until job security issues were clarified by Opel management.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect a statement from Opel management about job security and that they will fight with all their strength to save jobs in Germany,&quot; Mueller told Reuters.</p>
<p>An Opel spokesman declined comment on the statement. But Opel managing director David Herman told Reuters on Monday the carmaker has not yet made a final decision on how to deal with excess capacity in the industry and possible job cuts.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not based on some notion that we are going to produce less cars or sell less cars in Germany,&quot; he said. &quot;New investments and products will allow us to employ less people. This is a process that has been under way for some time.&quot;</p>
<p>Opel's troubles were also compounded on Tuesday when GM's European headquarters in Zurich said a senior marketing executive, Jonathan Browning, had quit to join the European operations of rival Ford Motor Co in England.</p>
<p>Browning's departure follows the highly-charged resignation last week of Juergen Stockmar, the Opel management board member in charge of technical development.</p>
<p>Both executives reportedly quit over GM's ambitious expansion programme into emerging markets and views at the carmaker that Opel's future is being compromised by Detroit taking away top managers and engineers for other projects.</p>
<p>A weekend report in Der Spiegel magazine also said an internal survey of top GM officials in Europe criticised GM's expansion strategy, saying the carmaker needed to devote more resources to European product development and quality measures.</p>
<p>Opel officials have also complained privately that GM will exploit Opel's resources to build plants in Latin America, Asia and eastern Europe at a time when Opel must develop new products to compete in the stiff European market.</p>
<p>Browning worked for GM in Zurich and oversaw marketing efforts for GM's Opel and Vauxhall brands as well as Saab and GM's North American vehicles sold in Europe.</p>
<p>Opel officials said Stockmar quit because he was not being given enough time to work on Opel products for the European market, where the carmaker has lost market share in 1997 along with other mass-market car producers.</p>
<p>The works council said it was aware of plans for Opel to cut up to 5,000 jobs by 2001, including 1,500 jobs at its main factory in Ruesselsheim, and that it has already told senior Opel management of its objections.</p>
<p>But Herman said Opel would keep building vehicles to meet German and European interests and that the international expansion plan was critical to securing Opel's future.</p>
<p>The carmaker on Tuesday issued a statement saying it was adding 90 new jobs at its plant in Eisenach, Germany, and would raise production by 15,000 vehicles a year to 177,000.</p>
