<p>Volkswagen AG, a day before it is to announce a response to a growing bribery scandal, said Tuesday that its group earnings more than doubled last year as sales expanded by 14 percent.</p>
<p>VW said profit at the company level rose to 678 million marks ($405 million) from 336 million marks ($201 million) in 1995 and earnings at the parent level rose 54 percent to 630 million marks ($376 million) from 410 million marks ($245 million).</p>
<p>The Wolfsburg-based automaker also proposed to its supervisory board that the dividend on 1996 results be raised to 318 million marks ($190 million). The payout on ordinary shares would be raised to 9 marks ($5.37) per share from 6 marks ($3.58) in 1995 and to 10 marks ($5.97) for preferred shares from 7 marks ($4.18).</p>
<p>John Lawson, analyst at Salomon Brothers in London, warned against reading too deeply into VW's results, known to be padded with provisions, saying VW was still performing better than its industry peers.</p>
<p>&quot;This company is still doing a lot better than its peer group and that will be influential in what happens to its share price in the future,&quot; Lawson said.</p>
<p>VW did not say whether the results reflected the $100 million payment made to General Motors Corp. as part of a deal reached in January to settle GM's lawsuit charging VW with industrial spying when it hired away purchasing guru Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua in 1993 from the U.S. automaker.</p>
<p>Stock traders were unimpressed with the results, saying the profit figures were below market expectations and that they were more concerned about allegations of some VW employees demanding and receiving bribes from industry suppliers.</p>
<p>VW shares fell as low as 795 marks ($475) in after-hours electronic trading before ending the day down 3.25 marks ($1.94) at 798 marks ($476).</p>
<p>A VW official confirmed Tuesday that the automaker would issue a statement Wednesday about the bribery allegations, which centre on the alleged payment of 20 million marks ($11.9 million) in bribes in connection with a 400 million mark ($229 million) plant expansion contract for VW's Czech Skoda unit.</p>
<p>Lopez, credited with helping to return VW to profitability, has been named by Germany's Der Spiegel magazine as being involved in the so-called &quot;Network&quot; that demanded 5 percent of a contract's value in kickbacks.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, has declined to comment on the magazine's allegations.</p>
