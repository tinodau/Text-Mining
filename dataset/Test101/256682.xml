<p>Top executives from Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp may meet next week to try to resolve a looming legal battle between the two firms, a German newspaper reported on Friday.</p>
<p>The daily Die Welt reported that VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen and Lower Saxony state premier Gerhard Schroeder would meet with GM executives John Smale and Thomas Wyman.</p>
<p>GM has alleged that former VW executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua took secret docuements from GM in 1993 when he quit the U.S. carmaker to join Volkswagen.</p>
<p>The two carmakers reportedly met in September on the Lopez affair, but made little progress toward averting a wider legal fight.</p>
<p>GM is expected to demand damages from VW at a jury trial  in the billions of dollars. The award could be tripled under U.S. racketeering laws first used to fight the mafia.</p>
<p>Attempts to settle the suit have failed because VW has rejected GM's conditions, which include severing all ties with Lopez, admitting wrongdoing and paying for damages.</p>
<p>The newspaper said VW might attempt to win GM over to an out-of-court settlement by offering to help the U.S. carmaker develop business in China -- a country where VW already has a strong presence.</p>
<p>It went on to say that a major stumbling block to any deal was differences of opinion held by GM and its German unit Adam Opel AG. The German unit, the newspaper said, was less willing to compromise than GM management in Detroit.</p>
<p>Lopez quit VW in late November to prepare his legal defence, but VW has said it may still work with Lopez on consulting projects.</p>
<p>Lopez's problems would not be entirely averted even if a deal were made with GM. German prosecutors have filed criminal charges against him. Sources have told Reuters that Lopez would face two charges for embezzlement and betrayal against GM.</p>
