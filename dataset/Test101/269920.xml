<p>The government said on Friday it may seek the death penalty in the case of former CIA station chief Harold Nicholson on the basis of newly disclosed evidence in the espionage case against him.</p>
<p>At a federal court hearing in Alexandria, Virginia, on an abortive fresh defence motion for bail, prosecutors described the potentially highly incriminating evidence as including 10 rolls of undeveloped film containing dozens of highly classified documents relating to Russia and still-uncracked coded messages on a computer disk.</p>
<p>Nicholson, the highest ranking Central Intelligence Agency officer ever to face espionage charges, is accused of selling national security secrets to Moscow for 29 months until his Nov. 16 arrest at Dulles Airport outside Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;The United States is still reviewing the numerous documents Nicholson attempted to pass on November 16, 1996 to determine whether any meet the statutory requirements for the death penalty,&quot; prosecutors said in a memorandum opposing the renewed bail request.</p>
<p>In announcing Nicholson's indictment on Nov. 21, U.S. Attorney Helen Fahey, who has overall responsibility for the prosecution, said statutory conditions for the death sentence had not been met &quot;based on the state of the investigation to date.&quot; At that time, she said Nicholson, a 16-year CIA veteran, faced life imprisonment without parole if convicted.</p>
<p>Under U.S. espionage statutes, the death penalty may be imposed if death resulted from the crime or if the defendant gave away the most sensitive national security secrets such as spy satellite or nuclear weapons technology.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Rob Chesnut, who is leading the prosecution, told the court that U.S. experts had not yet cracked the &quot;45- or 65-character code&quot; used to encrypt the computer disk he said had been found along with the film rolls in a lead-lined carry-on bag.</p>
<p>Nicholson was arrested by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents as he prepared to fly to Zurich, allegedly to meet with Russian spymasters who paid him more than $180,000.</p>
<p>Chief U.S. District Court Judge James Cacheris rejected the defence request to revoke a magistrate's order that Nicholson be held without bail until his trial. He ruled that, now that Nicholson faces possible execution if convicted, he has an even stronger incentive to flee and would pose &quot;an unacceptable danger&quot; to the community if released.</p>
<p>Cacheris agreed to a defence request to delay the start of Nicholson's trial so his court-appointed lawyers could have more time to prepare. He set a trial date of April 14, two weeks sooner than they had sought but later than March 10, when the trial was originally due to begin.</p>
<p>The possibility that the government could seek the death penalty may increase pressure on Nicholson to cooperate in assessments of the national security harm he allegedly caused.</p>
<p>Aldrich Ames, a confessed CIA turncoat, was sentenced to life imprisonment in April 1994 as part of a deal under which he admitted betraying Soviet and East Bloc spies who were secretly on the U.S. payroll.</p>
<p>The government said at least 10 of those agents were later killed or disappeared. As part of the deal, Ames' wife Rosario, who pleaded guilty with him, was jailed for at least four years, less than might have otherwise been the case.</p>
<p>At the hearing, prosecutors disclosed they had arranged to move Nicholson, 46, from Alexandria City Jail, where has been detained since his arrest, to a more secure local facilty that they did not identify. Liam O'Grady, one of Nicholson's two co-lead counsels, opposed the move as an attempt to isolate him from the company of other inmates.</p>
<p>Among those currently being held at the Alexandria jail with Nicholson was Earl Edwin Pitts, a 43-year-old FBI supervisor arrested on Wednesday on charges of selling spy-catching secrets to Moscow for at least $224,000.</p>
