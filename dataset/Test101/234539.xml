<p>German carmaker Audi AG said on Wednesday its chief executive would leave to head the Latin American arm of parent Volkswagen in the latest management change after a VW executive tied to a spying scandal resigned.</p>
<p>Herbert Demel, chairman of Audi since February 1994, has been chosen to be president of Volkswagen's Latin American arm based in Brazil, which industry analysts say could put Demel in contention to be a future VW chairman.</p>
<p>Audi said Demel will be replaced by Audi management board member Franz-Josef Paefgen as leader of the Ingolstadt-based carmaker when the transition takes place in mid-1997.</p>
<p>Paefgen, 50, joined the Audi management board in March 1994 and has been responsible for technical development. He started his career in the German car industry as a trainee in 1976 with the German arm of Ford Motor Corp and joined Audi in 1980.</p>
<p>Industry sources confirmed on Tuesday the anticipated management changes among the foreign arms of VW, which include Spain's SEAT and Skoda in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Demel, 43, had been tipped to lead the VW regional group after the current leader of VW's Latin American operations, Pierre-Alain de Smedt, was selected to be chairman of SEAT.</p>
<p>De Smedt, a Belgian, was named in October to head SEAT after outgoing chairman Juan Llorens was believed by observers to have lost the confidence of Piech after ongoing losses.</p>
<p>VW said Demel's move was not related to the resignation last Friday of VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who was also chairman of VW's Latin American arm.</p>
<p>VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech will take on Lopez's job title in Brazil, which is the largest foreign unit operated by VW with 10 billion marks ($6.4 billion) in yearly sales.</p>
<p>But industry officials noted that Lopez, a Spaniard, had long been seen as a top candidate to take over SEAT, eliminating the need for Demel and de Smedt to be transferred.</p>
<p>Lopez is one of several top VW officials, including Piech, who are defendants in a U.S. civil lawsuit filed by U.S. carmaker General Motors Corp and its German unit Opel that allege VW committed industrial spying when Lopez and seven associates left GM in 1993 to join VW.</p>
<p>Lopez, according to his lawyers, quit his VW position to prepare his defence to allegations in the U.S. lawsuit as well as those expected in German criminal charges.</p>
<p>VW has vehemently denied the charges of industrial spying.</p>
<p>Audi said the decision, which calls for Demel to start his duties at the Latin American unit in January while also in control of Audi, was made by its supervisory board at a meeting in Hungary where the carmaker has a new production facility.</p>
<p>Demel has been credited with invigorating Audi, which has shed its drab image and now that turns out award-winning models, like the A4 saloon.</p>
<p>&quot;He has been an outstanding leader that has put Audi back on a track to profitability and has overseen the development of a number of new profitable and exciting models,&quot; one industry official who asked not be named said about Demel.</p>
<p>Although Audi has higher annual revenues than the Brazil unit, Demel is seen by industry analysts to be a top contender to succeed Piech, who was also once chief executive at Audi. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525 ($1=1.5599 Mark)</p>
