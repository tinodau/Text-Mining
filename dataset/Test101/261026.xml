<p>The chief of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said on Tuesday foreign espionage still posed a major threat to national interests five years after the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p>Nikolai Kovalyov, speaking at a rare news conference, said organised crime and terrorism were also seriously undermining Russia's security as it moved towards a free market economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Suppressing the activities of foreign intelligence on the territory of our country continues to be the main task of the FSB. Unfortunately we cannot expect any diminution in their activities in the coming years,&quot; Kovalyov said.</p>
<p>He said the FSB had exposed some 400 employees of foreign intelligence organisations and 39 Russian citizens working for them in the past two years.</p>
<p>The FSB has also uncovered more than 100 attempts by Russian citizens to pass on intelligence to foreign organisations on their own initiative, Kovalyov added.</p>
<p>He singled out the case of Platon Obukhov, a foreign ministry official charged with high treason earlier this year after passing on secrets to Britain. Kovalyov said Obukhov had seriously damaged Russia's national interests.</p>
<p>The case triggered a Cold War-style tit-for-tat expulsion row in which London declared four Russian diplomats persona non grata in response to Moscow's decision to expel the same number of British Embassy employees.</p>
<p>Kovalyov said Russia had recently lodged an official protest with Turkey over suspected espionage activity in the sensitive Northern Caucasus region that includes breakaway Chechnya.</p>
<p>Russia is currently withdrawing its troops from Chechnya after a failed 21-month military campaign to crush the region's independence bid.</p>
<p>Asked about the danger of increased terrorist activity in the region, Kovalyov said it was in the interests of the Chechen separatist government to tackle the problem.</p>
<p>&quot;They have to show that they can control the situation in their country...If there is an explosion of terrorist activity in Chechnya it will be a big blow to their authority,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday six Western staff members of the International Committee of the Red Cross were killed in their beds in the worst incident involving foreign aid workers in the turbulent oil-rich region.</p>
<p>Russian and Chechen officials are also trying to negotiate the release of 21 Russian Interior Ministry troops seized by rebel gunmen at the weekend.</p>
<p>Kovalyov said the FSB had already helped free 111 Russians taken hostage by separatists during nearly two years of war.</p>
<p>He said he was alarmed by an upsurge in terrorist acts carried out with no apparent motive as these were particularly difficult crimes to solve.</p>
<p>Moscow's Metro and trolleybuses were the target of several mysterious bomb attacks earlier this year. Kovalyov said the FSB would shortly publish the results of its investigation into the attacks, which threw security chiefs into panic at the time.</p>
<p>But Kovalyov said President Boris Yeltsin's decision last year to set up a special anti-terrorist centre in the FSB had greatly facilitated Russia's fight against terrorism.</p>
<p>The FSB is also battling to control organised crime, whose tentacles reach into the highest echelons of power as criminal groups lobby state organs to protect their shady business interests, he said.</p>
<p>Some 500 state officials are currently under investigation on suspicion of taking bribes, usually involving huge sums of money, Kovalyov said.</p>
