<title>GERMANY: Audi chief named to head VW Brazil unit.</title>
<headline>Audi chief named to head VW Brazil unit.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-12-04</dateline>

<p>German luxury carmaker Audi AG, a unit of Volkswagen AG, said on Wednesday that Audi chief executive Herbert Demel has been chosen to lead the Brazil unit of VW from mid-1997.</p>
<p>The carmaker also said that Audi management board member Franz-Josef Paefgen has been selected to replace Demel as head of the Ingolstadt-based luxury carmaker.</p>
<p>Industry sources had confirmed the management changes at Audi on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>The decision was made by Audi's supervisory board in the Hungarian city of Gyor, where the Ingolstadt-based carmaker has a new production facility.</p>
<p>Demel has been chosen to lead the VW's Latin American unit following the resignation last week of VW executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who faces allegations of industrial spying in a U.S. civil court lawsuit and also in Germany.</p>
<p>Lopez resigned last Friday to prepare his defence for allegations that he and a group of former executive at Opel AG and parent company General Motors Corp stole secret documents when they abruptly quit to join VW in March 1993.</p>
<p>Several German newspapers have recently reported that Demel, an Austrian who had been in charge at Audi for 2-1/2 years, would give up his position and take up responsibility for Volkswagen's Latin American business.</p>
<p>Demel, who was named management board chairman at Audi in February 1994, has been credited with invigorating Audi to shed its drab image in favour of a carmaker that makes award-winning models, such as the A4 saloon that has underpinned its revival.</p>
<p>He is also considered by industry analysts to be a top contender to succeed Piech, who was also once chief executive at Audi, in the future as the top official at VW.</p>
<p>Paefgen, 50, joined the Audi management board in March 1994 and has been responsible for technical development. He started his career in the car industry as a trainee in 1976 with the German unit of Ford Motor Corp and joined Audi in 1980.</p>
<p>Lopez is one of several top VW officials, including VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech, who are named as defendants in a U.S. civil lawsuit filed by GM and Opel that allege the company committed industrial spying.</p>
<p>VW on Monday said Piech has taken over some of the VW group duties held by Lopez but also promoted a protogee of Lopez -- and also a defendant in a U.S. lawsuit filed by GM against VW -- to the VW management board in charge of purchasing.</p>
<p>The official, Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, 39, is one of seven close associates of Lopez who left GM with him to join VW. GM has demanded that Garcia Sanz and the others also leave VW before any discussion of an out-of-court settlement.</p>
