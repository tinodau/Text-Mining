<p>Volkswagen AG is secretly negotiating with General Motors Corp to reach an out-of-court settlement on charges it engaged in industrial espionage, Germany's Spiegel magazine reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>Spiegel will say in its Monday edition, released in advance, that VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen has met with GM general council chief John Smale in Detroit to consider a settlement of the legal fight.</p>
<p>Volkswagen spokesman Klaus Kocks would not comment on the report.</p>
<p>The case has been centred on VW executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua who has been under investigation for allegedly taking confidential documents from Opel, an unit of GM, and GM itself in 1993 when he joined VW, the largest car maker in Europe.</p>
<p>The magazine reported that VW was seeking an agreement with GM because recent court decisions related the case have not gone in its favour and because the German car making company faces potential judgements against in the U.S. totalling billions of dollars.</p>
<p>VW also thought that American executives would be more willing to reach an agreement than GM and Opel management in Germany who have been closely involved in the protracted legal battle, the magazine said.</p>
<p>The report follows a string of court judgements against VW in its legal fight with GM as well as with U.S. authorities who began their own independent criminal investigation into the allegations of spying.</p>
<p>A spokesman for lawyer Juergen Toschke, who is representing Lopez, said on Saturday the court had ruled that certain documents must be made available to U.S. authorities if requested by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Justice Department.</p>
<p>The ruling, which was intitially concealed after Friday's court session, applied to a study by auditors KPMG, the protocol of witnesses statements and the statement of the defence, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has asked for documents on Lopez and others in a legal fight against VW's rival Opel AG.</p>
<p>VW has fought the document transfer by saying the rights of Lopez and other people would be violated and that German courts should have jurisdiction over the overall issue.</p>
<p>Lopez's German lawyer said earlier in November that he expected German prosecutors in Darmstadt to soon file criminal charges related to industrial spying against his client. Prosecutors have said a decision would be made by year-end.</p>
<p>If the Frankfurt court complies with the U.S. request for the information, the files could be put before a U.S. grand jury in Detroit, the hometown of GM.</p>
<p>VW also suffered a legal setback in the U.S. several weeks ago when a U.S. district court in Detroit rejected VW's attempts to have the lawsuit -- which include racketeering charges based on organised crime statutes -- dismissed.</p>
<p>In addition to Lopez, the U.S. lawsuit filed by GM names, among others, VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech.</p>
<p>The Detroit federal court is scheduled to issue a written decision by November 26 on the inclusion of the racketeering charges, which are based on RICO statutes initially used to fight the mafia and whose use has been expanded.</p>
