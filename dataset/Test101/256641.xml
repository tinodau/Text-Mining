<p>German prosecutors said on Friday they had found no indication that staff at Volkswagen AG had colluded with VW's former production chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and three other former General Motors executives in alleged embezzlement and the betrayal of GM secrets.</p>
<p>Asked if the prosecutors had in their investigation of alleged industrial espionage by Lopez found that VW colluded in the alleged transfer of GM secrets to VW, Gerhard Andres, the leading prosecutor in the Darmstadt public prosecutor's office, said:</p>
<p>&quot;I say with all clarity that although we always kept an eye on this suspicion the investigation found no sufficient indications that someone from VW in any way colluded in the alleged deeds as we have presented them here relating to Lopez and the others.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Instead we could only ascertain that insofar as talks were held with Mr Lopez they only related to his transfer to the VW group.&quot;  </p>

<p>Earlier, prosecutors said they had on December 6 filed criminal charges against Lopez as well as three other former GM employees identified as Jose Manuel Gutierrez, Rosario Piazza and Jorge Alvarez.</p>
<p>The four were charged under allegations of embezzlement and betrayal of corporate secrets, the prosecutor's office said.</p>
