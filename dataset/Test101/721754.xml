<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Friday.</p>
<p>LONDON - Shares closed higher for a third straight session, as a continuing robust performance on Wall Street helped drag the FTSE 100 index of blue chip stocks within striking distance of its record high. The FTSE 100 closed at 4,799.5, up 31.7 points, or 0.66 percent. There was a fall of 13.3 points from last week.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Germany's IBIS DAX ended computer dealings at a fresh record high of 4,074.30 points, up 73.65 points, or 1.84 percent, as the market found renewed hope from Wall Street gains and the dollar trading at 71-month highs against the mark. In earlier trade the DAX-30 index closed at 4,040.97, up 48.59 points, or 1.22 percent, giving a rise of 98.44 on the week.</p>
<p>PARIS - Shares ended firmer, benefiting from dollar strength, traders said. Volume was fairly thin ahead the long weekend with markets closed on Monday for the national July 14 holiday. The CAC-40 index closed at 2,941.59, up 12.50 points, or 0.43 percent and rising 7.11 points from last week.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Shares ended more than one percent lower, extending the correction which started on Thursday after a string of record highs, dealers said. The Swiss market index closed at 5,801.5, down 83.9 points, or 1.43 percent on the day and down 45 points on the week.</p>
<p>MILAN - Shares closed at a new record high, lifted by a strong showing at the opening on Wall Street and lira strength against the mark and a revival of interest in giant insurer Generali. The All Share Mibtel index closed at 14,018, up 190 points, or 1.37 percent, up 410 points on the week.</p>
<p>AMSTERDAM - Shares rallied to fresh highs, with both main share indices setting a record close as market players revelled in a row of positive factors. The AEX index closed at 936.51, up 11.80 points, or 1.28 percent. There was a rise of 29.32 from last week.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Stocks closed moderately higher, as lingering worries over the financial health of some companies prompted investors to actively seek high-technology issues that are backed by strong earnings, brokers said. The 225-share Nikkei average closed at 19,875.49, up 120.71 points, or 0.61 percent. This was down 92.51 from last Friday.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Stocks closed stronger as a technical rebound pushed up the blue chip Hang Seng Index by 386.06 points, or 2.60 percent, to 15,225.29, for a rise of 402.32 points on the week. &quot;This is a technical rebound since the market has been oversold on the daily chart,&quot; said Calvin Chan, technical analyst at J&amp;A securities.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Shares closed slightly firmer, with gold stocks rebounding after this week's heavy sell-off. But the market finished the week weaker due to the precious metal's continuing woes. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,699.1, up 4.7 points, or 0.17 percent but showed a fall of 34.30 from the previous Friday's close.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - Shares put a quiet end to a topsy-turvy week as they finished a healthy trading session with their heads just above opening levels, dealers said. The All-share index closed at 7,348.0, up 10.1 points, or 0.14 percent, down 20 points from a week ago. The All Gold index closed at 964.8, up 17.4 points, or 0.09 percent, for a rise of 12.7 since last week. While the Industrial index closed at 8,806.6, up 8.1 points, or 1.84 percent. This was up 4.7 from last Friday.</p>
