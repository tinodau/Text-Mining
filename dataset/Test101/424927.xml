<p>General Motors said on Thursday that Volkswagen's aggressive policies had prompted a price war in Europe's car market which has led some manufacturers to fire workers and look closely at future production plans.</p>
<p>General Motors Europe President Richard Donnelly also said in an interview that Korean and Japanese sales posed a threat in Europe.</p>
<p>Korea should open its markets to international competition. This would take the steam out of suspicions that Korean trading practices were unfair, Donnelly said.</p>
<p>He said Germany's VW, the market leader in Europe, had sharpened up its management but also taken action tantamount to buying sales.</p>
<p>&quot;I think VW has done a couple of things. They are managing their total portfolio pretty well of SEAT, Skoda, VW and Audi,&quot; Donnelly said on the Opel stand at the Geneva car show. The VW group operates these four marques.</p>
<p>&quot;VW also seems to be very, very aggressive on price and for whatever reason I don't know but, you can buy (market) share at a price, and they have been extremely aggressive on price, so I think these two things are why they have been gaining some share,&quot; Donnelly said.</p>
<p>A VW spokesman was not available for comment.</p>
<p>GM Europe sells Opels and Vauxhalls and has a half share and management control of Swedish niche producer Saab.</p>
<p>Donnelly said Opel and Vauxhall had been drawn in to the sales/price dogfight to a degree, but not as much as VW.</p>
<p>VW raised its market share in Europe last year to 17.2 percent from 16.8 percent. Opel/Vauxhall was second with 12.5 percent, Peugeot Citroen of France was next with 11.9 percent, followed by Ford (11.6 percent) and Fiat of Italy (11.2). France's Renault had 10.1 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts have been applauding VW's revitalisation.</p>
<p>&quot;VW has been a tottering giant, massive and slow to respond, but look at them now. They've broken with tradition and suddenly developed teeth and are prepared to use them, and did they use them. 1996 was VW's year,&quot; said Peter Schmidt of Britain's Automotive Industry Data.</p>
<p>Schmidt, joint managing director at A.I.D., said VW had stolen a march on the competition with price cuts and marketing spending. Consumers, once won over, are reluctant to swap brands.</p>
<p>&quot;This is all gloomy news for Peugeot and Renault. I feel they've made a fundamental blunder in not taking part in this marketing war. GM too. They are not competing aggressively enough, and that applies to Ford and Fiat as well,&quot; Schmidt said.</p>
<p>But Donnelly said over-aggressive actions, particularly from companies that are weak financially, made little sense.</p>
<p>&quot;We are willing to give up a little share frankly if we can run profitably. If you look at some of the companies that are dropping price they are already in a loss position which seems strange,&quot; Donnelly said.</p>
<p>These price wars have devastated some profit margins, although VW has improved its financial position, and GM has retained its lead as the most profitable European car company, according to London's Economist Intelligence Unit.</p>
<p>&quot;We never predict profits, but I'll tell you this. I think for all the manufacturers it's going to be a difficult year. I think aggressive pricing has reduced margins, so we are all going to have to scramble,&quot; Donnelly said.</p>
