<headline>France says watching Iran's trial of writer.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-06-26</dateline>
<text>
<p>France said on Thursday it was watching the trial in Iran of a journalist accused of espionage for signs of an improvement in Tehran's human rights record.</p>
<p>&quot;We are paying close attention to the fate of journalist Faraj Sarkuhi,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said.</p>
<p>&quot;In a general manner, the question of human rights is one area where we are expecting a change from Iran,&quot; he said at the ministry's daily media briefing.</p>
<p>The spokesman said France found initial statements by Iran's president-elect, former culture minister Mohammad Khatami, &quot;encouraging.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We strongly hope they (the statements) will be followed by actions,&quot; Rummelhardt said.</p>
<p>The head of Iran's judiciary Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi said on Tuesday that Sarkuhi had been charged with espionage and would be tried soon.</p>
<p>Sarkuhi, editor of the monthly Adineh (Friday), has alleged in a letter smuggled out of Iran that he was held for six weeks and tortured by the Iranian secret service in Tehran late last year to force him to confess to spying for Germany.</p>
<p>Human rights and press freedom groups have since said that the trial had begun and that Sarkuhi was being deprived of legal representation.</p>
<p>The London-based human rights group Amnesty International said it believed Sarkuhi was a prisoner of conscience.</p>
