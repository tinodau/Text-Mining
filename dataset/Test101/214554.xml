<p>German carmaker Adam Opel AG accused Volkswagen AG Monday of delaying a U.S. criminal probe of top VW executives on industrial spying charges by blocking the forwarding of documents for a year.</p>
<p>Opel confirmed that a Frankfurt appellate court ordered that information collected by German prosecutors be sent to the U.S. Justice Department, fulfilling a request Washington made some two years ago, which VW had sought to block.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt court said Friday the judge's decision had already been given to VW and Opel, a unit of General Motors Corp., and would be released publicly this week.</p>
<p>The documents to be turned over -- including 200 transcripts of witness interviews and a complete report by accounting firm KPMG -- are linked to the German criminal probe of VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.</p>
<p>Lopez's German lawyer said in early November that he expected German prosecutors to file criminal charges related to industrial spying against Lopez soon for allegedly taking secret documents when he abruptly left GM in 1993 for VW.</p>
<p>&quot;The ruling by the Frankfurt appellate court demonstrates that VW has once again failed in an attempt to impede a judicial clarification of the VW/Lopez case as well as the criminal prosecution in Germany and the U.S.,&quot; Opel said.</p>
<p>VW, which has denied the industrial spying charges, had fought the document transfer by saying the rights of Lopez and other VW officials under investigation would be violated.</p>
<p>VW declined to comment on the Opel statement.</p>
<p>The German documents will be given to U.S. prosecutors reviewing criminal allegations against Lopez and top VW officials, including VW Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech, before a U.S. grand jury in Detroit.</p>
<p>Under U.S. law, a criminal indictment can be filed against both a corporation and also the responsible individual members of that company's management.</p>
<p>In addition, Opel and VW both declined comment Monday on a weekend magazine report in Germany saying they were in secret negotiations to reach an out-of-court settlement in the U.S. civil lawsuit GM filed against VW in a Detroit federal court.</p>
<p>A GM spokesman in Detroit also declined to comment on the report in Spiegel magazine.</p>
<p>Spiegel reported that VW Supervisory Board Chairman Klaus Liesen had met with GM executive John Smale in Detroit to consider a deal to end the American legal fight between the two major carmakers.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a subject I'm not going to get into,&quot; said GM spokesman John Mueller. Smale, the former non-executive chairman of GM, is chairman of the automaker's executive committee.</p>
<p>GM filed a civil suit in U.S. District Court in Detroit last March alleging that Lopez and several other VW executives stole trade secrets when they left GM for VW in March 1993.</p>
<p>VW could face damages of hundreds of millions of dollars, possibly billions, if GM were to win the civil suit, officials familiar with GM's lawsuit against VW said.</p>
<p>The Wolfsburg-based carmaker is likely to suffer more bad news soon regarding the fight in Detroit, GM's hometown.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds was reported ready to issue a ruling Tuesday that allows GM to include charges filed under the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act against VW.</p>
<p>Edmunds heard arguments on that motion last month but a spokesman declined to comment Monday on the report.</p>
<p>If a jury found VW guilty of violating the so-called RICO statute, it could force VW to pay triple damages.</p>
