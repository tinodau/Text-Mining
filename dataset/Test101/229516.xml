<p>Lopez is the target of a German criminal investigation for allegedly stealing secret documents from GM when he joined Volkswagen in March 1993.</p>
<p>GM has filed a U.S. civil lawsuit against VW and Lopez, also also other top VW officials, that observers say will seek possibly billions of marks in damages.</p>
<p>Lopez's lawyers said he resigned from VW to prepare his defence against criminal charges expected to be filed by year-end by German prosecutors.</p>
