<headline>VW plans to introduce new mini-car - newspaper.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT, Germany</dateline>
<text>
<p>Volkswagen AG will soon introduce a new mini-car in a bid to prove that small vehicles can be built profitably in Germany, according to a newspaper.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt Allgemeine Zeitung reported Saturday that VW will soon unveil the VW Lupino, which is slated to be offered to the public during 1997.</p>
<p>VW, Europe's largest carmaker, will also offer a similar vehicle from its Spanish subsidiary SEAT, which will be called the &quot;Arosa.&quot; It will be introduced before the VW version.</p>
<p>The SEAT version of the four-seat vehicle, which is based on a shortened platform of the subcompact VW Polo but uses the same engine, will cost about 17,000 marks ($11,000).</p>
<p>The better-equipped Lupino will be more expensive, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Wolfsburg-based VW was not available over the weekend to comment on the new vehicle, which is the developed version of a concept car first shown at the 1991 Frankfurt auto show.</p>
<p>The newspaper said VW wanted to build the vehicle at its Wolfsburg plant to demonstrate that small vehicles can be made in Germany at a profit despite the country's higher wage costs and also to take advantage of excess production capacity.</p>
<p>The new vehicle can be built in about seven hours, which is about half the prodution time of the subcompact VW polo and about a quarter of the time needed to build the popular VW Golf, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The vehicle relies heavily on new work practices as well as heavy outsourcing of parts and materials to reduce costs and production time, according to the newspaper report.</p>
