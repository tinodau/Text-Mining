<p>Human rights and environmental groups are urging Moscow to drop espionage charges against a former Russian naval captain, who last year brought to light radioactive pollution left by the Russian fleet in the Arctic and Pacific Oceans.</p>
<p>The fifty groups, including Sierra Club, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch, asked U.S. Vice President Al Gore to raise the case of Aleksandr Nikitin in his meeting on Thursday with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>In letters sent on Jan. 31 to Gore and Chernomyrdin, the groups said charges against Nikitin should be dismissed, and he should be allowed to travel freely.</p>
<p>They said they were &quot;deeply concerned about the Russian government's current charges against Aleksandr Nikitin in an attempt to keep secret the nuclear hazards caused by the Russian North Sea Fleet.&quot;</p>
<p>Nikitin was held in prison for six months without charges &quot;on suspicion of espionage and revealing state secrets, crimes possibly punishable by death,&quot; the U.S. State Department said last week in its world human rights report, citing the case as &quot;fraught with numerous violations of due process.&quot;</p>
<p>He was released in December but has not been allowed to leave St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>&quot;It's an ongoing concern of ours,&quot; said a State Department official, who said the issue might be raised in a private session between Gore and Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>Nikitin's work was important in alerting the world to a major problem with &quot;disastrous implications for other countries sharing these waters,&quot; the groups said.</p>
