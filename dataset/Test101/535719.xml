<title>USA: Blue-chip stocks give back IBM-led rally.</title>
<headline>Blue-chip stocks give back IBM-led rally.</headline>

<p>Blue-chip stocks retreated quickly Thursday after an early earnings-driven jump in the shares of International Business Machines Corp. sparked a rise of nearly 80 points in the Dow Jones industrial average.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EDT, the Dow was off 13.24 points at 6,799.48 after the blue-chip index topped out at 6,890.59, which was just short of a key upside resistance at 6,900.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues led declines by a small margin on volume of 282 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The market's pullback was led by a drop in the shares of AlliedSignal Inc. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co., both of which reported quarterly earnings.</p>
<p>IBM leaped 10-7/8 to 153-1/4 on its better-than-expected earnings, which were reported after the close of trading Wednesday. It earned $1.19 billion, or $2.37 a share, well above Wall Street estimates for $2.28 a share.</p>
<p>The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index, which was also energised by IBM's earnings, slid off its highs but remained in positive territory, with a gain of 4.86 points to 1,232.00.</p>
<p>&quot;The weakness can be attributed to some gain in the long bond yield and technical resistance at 6,900,&quot; said Eugene Peroni, chief technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that 6,900 is a key technical point in the Dow. We had a big move this week, and some stocks in the Dow are overbought. They need to come back down to their mid-levels,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>AlliedSignal was down 2-1/8 at 71-5/8 and Procter &amp; Gamble fell 2-1/8 to 123-5/8.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the 30-year Treasury was off 5/32 point, raising its yield to 7.10 percent from 7.08 percent at Wednesday's close. The price and yield move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>Larry Wachtel, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said stock traders were cautious ahead of economic reports next week that could threaten the bond market, including the jobs report.</p>
<p>&quot;First of all, half of the move today was one stock,&quot; Wachtel said, referring to IBM.</p>
<p>&quot;The question is should we press this advance forward ahead of the economic reports and run the risk of having the bond market against us? It's asking too much to keep going because some quarters came in well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Among special situations, Dow Chemical Co. rose 1-7/8 at 81-5/8 after it reported flat first quarter earnings but said it expected a strong quarter in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Computer Associates International Inc. jumped as much as 14 percent after the giant software company said its latest quarterly earnings likely would be better than Wall Street expected. The stock was up 4-1/2 at 48-1/2.</p>
