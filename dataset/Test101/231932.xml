<headline>U.S. judge's ruling bolsters GM's suit against VW.</headline>

<p>General Motors Corp., bolstered by another favorable ruling in its industrial espionage lawsuit against Volkswagen AG, said Monday it was not ready to to settle the high-profile case.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds on Monday cleared the way for the suit to proceed toward trial by denying Volkswagen's remaining preliminary motions in the case.</p>
<p>In the ruling, Edmunds allowed GM to pursue claims that Volkswagen and several of its top executives violated copyright, trademark and unfair competition laws in an alleged scheme to steal GM trade secrets.</p>
<p>Last week, Edmunds allowed GM's claims to proceed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -- which could lead to triple damages against VW reaching into the billions of dollars.</p>
<p>GM spokesman John Mueller said no settlement talks had taken place on Monday, despite the resignation of VW's production chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, on Friday.</p>
<p>GM and its Adam Opel subsidiary in Germany have accused Lopez and other top VW executives of forming a conspiracy to steal GM trade secrets when Lopez and several others abruptly quit GM to join the German automaker in 1993.</p>
<p>Mueller said VW also must acknowledge wrongdoing and compensate GM for its damages.</p>
<p>&quot;The harm caused to GM and Opel caused by the wrongful conduct of Lopez and his collaborators remains to be remedied,&quot; Mueller said Monday.</p>
<p>GM officials also said they were astounded at news that VW would meet the obligations of Lopez's contract, paying him about $2.6 million through March 1998.</p>
<p>&quot;This is absolutely not sufficient,&quot; said one GM executive who asked not to be identified. &quot;Letting him resign and then having top executives praise him and say that they can see him as a top consultant in the future does not meet our requirements.&quot;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Edmunds will meet with lawyers from both sides to set a schedule and procedures for discovery, the process of taking sworn statements from witnesses and disclosing other evidence in the case.</p>
<p>David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive transportation, said GM would likely let VW squirm for a while as the case proceeds, but will ultimately settle.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think either company wants to go to court,&quot; Cole said. &quot;It'll be the corporate equivalent of the O.J. (Simpson) case, with unbelievable media attention.&quot;</p>
<p>GM has won the early procedural rounds, but none of them have dealt with the merits of its claims.</p>
<p>&quot;Her (Edmunds') decision supports our position and clears the way for those allegations to be heard in the upcoming trial along with our RICO claims,&quot; Mueller said of Monday's decision.</p>
<p>In Germany on Monday, Volkswagen Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech, who also is named as a defendant in the GM suit, took over some of Lopez' responsibilities.</p>
<p>An internal memo by Piech to top VW executives dated Monday said Piech has taken over group-wide control of &quot;product optimization and procurement&quot; following the resignation last Friday of Lopez.</p>
<p>The management reshuffling at VW included the naming of Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, who followed Lopez to VW from GM, to the VW management board from his current position as a senior executive at VW's Spanish subisidary SEAT.</p>
<p>Garcia Sanz will oversee VW purchasing activities, according to the memo obtained by Reuters. VW executive Peter Hartz was also named to take over Lopez's duties with VW's America and Africa units.</p>
<p>Piech made the management changes as VW stock fell nearly 6 percent on Monday after GM said it would not let up on its legal battle against the Wolfsburg-based carmaker, Europe's biggest.</p>
<p>Volkswagen shares fell 34.50 marks to 582 marks ($375) but pared some of the losses to end bourse trade down 29.50 marks at 587 marks ($378).</p>
