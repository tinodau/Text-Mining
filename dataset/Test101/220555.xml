<p>German shares were expected to experience a period of stable trade in the near-term after Tuesday's record high levels, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said afternoon dealings were being slightly pressured by early losses on Wall Street, but said the effect was only short term and the DAX index of 30 top shares should not suffer too much.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX index was down 14.77 points, or 0.53 percent, at 2,793.82 points shortly before the close of trade, losing ground after the Dow Jones started weaker and German bonds lost most of their sheen.  </p>
<p>The DAX touched a day low of 2,786.61 points after U.S. durable goods data came in stronger than expected, reviving some inflation worries and causing German bonds to erase strong gains made earlier in the day.</p>
<p>But dealers said that the upward trend in the DAX was still intact and that a slight correction was perfectly healthy for the market.</p>
<p>Dealers said the day's main focus had been shares in Volkswagen AG, which ended computer dealings down five percent, or 32.50 marks at 608 marks, after a U.S. judge denied VW's motion to dismiss racketeering claims by rival Opel.  </p>
<p>The ruling could open VW to potentially higher damages in the lawsuit with Opel, a subsidiary of U.S. carmaker General Motors.</p>
<p>VW shares were also under pressure after the firm said it could introduce short-time working hours at its main plant because a French truck blockade has hit the supply of car parts.</p>
<p>Dealers said VW's lossed had weighed on the whole market and on other shares in the car sector in particular. BMW AG ended IBIS dealings down 8.60 marks at 972.50 marks and Daimler-Benz AG was 1.15 marks off at 98.60 marks.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, shares in airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG ended down 28 pfennigs at 19.90 marks. The company is due to report nine month figures on Thursday.</p>
<p>Late on Wednesday the German trade union involved in a pay dispute with Lufthansa said it could not rule out further stoppages.</p>
<p>Dealers said trade volume was likely to be thinner than normal on Thursday, with the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S..</p>
