<p>Qatar said a decision on Saturday by Bahrain to pardon two Qataris convicted of spying could help improve relations between the two Gulf Arab neighbours.</p>
<p>&quot;We welcome the good news and believe the gesture will help clear the mist of mistrust between our two countries,&quot; a senior Qatari official told Reuters..</p>
<p>Bahrain's Emir Sheikh Issa bin Sulman al-Khalifa pardoned Fahad Hamad Abdullah al-Baker and Salwa Jassim Mohammed Fakhri. A state security court on Wednesday had sentenced the two Qataris to three years in jail and fined them 1,000 dinars ($2,652) each for spying for Qatar.</p>
<p>The case had raised tensions between Bahrain and Qatar, already strained by a territorial dispute over small islands in the Gulf controlled by Bahrain since the 1930s but also claimed by Qatar.</p>
<p>&quot;The emiri decree includes dropping all their penalties and releasing them,&quot; Bahrain Cabinet and Information Minister Mohammad Ibrahim al-Mutawae said in a statement sent to Reuters.</p>
<p>Mutawae said the pardon followed an appeal to Sheikh Isa in which the two Qataris &quot;regretted their acts against Bahrain and sought clemency.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bahraini minister said the pardon was part of Sheikh Isa's initiatives to maintain good relations between the peoples of Bahrain and Qatar.</p>
<p>&quot;We were expecting their release because we were sure that they were innocent and their trial was simply for political considerations,&quot; said the Qatari official.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, we hope things will improve and the two neighbours will concentrate on solving their outstanding problems in a brotherly spirit,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Qatar on Wednesday demanded the immediate release of the two men. Qatar had also accused Bahrain of torturing al-Baker and said the trial &quot;sets a dangerous precedent in Gulf's ties&quot;. Bahrain denied the charge.</p>
<p>Qatar had taken their long-standing border dispute to the International Court of Justice in the Hague in 1991. The move angered Bahrain, which prefers a regional solution.</p>
<p>The dispute prompted Bahrain to boycott a two-day summit of leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) which ended in the Qatari capital Doha on December 9.</p>
<p>The GCC, a political and economic alliance, also groups Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. It decided to form a committee to resolve the dispute. Foreign ministers of the GCC attending a meeting in Cairo on Saturday were expected to discuss the problem.</p>
