<p>U.S. Treasury prices opened slightly lower on Thursday ahead of three significant economic reports.</p>
<p>New jobless claims for the week ended on June 14 are expected to come down 333,000 from higher levels posted in the last two weeks, according to economists polled by Reuters.</p>
<p>If, contrary to expectations, jobless claims total 340,000 or more in the latest week, that might hint at some cooling in a tight labor market, economists said.  </p>
<p>At the same time that the Labor Department releases its 0830 EDT/1230 GMT data on new jobless claims for the latest week, the Commerce Department will release international trade figures for April.</p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters forecast, on average, that the U.S. trade gap widened to $10.0 billion in April from an $8.51 billion deficit in March.</p>
<p>Analysts said the April trade data affect the Treasury market indirectly, allowing economists to fine-tune their second-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimates. But the data are more relevant to the currency markets, they said.  </p>
<p>The Philadelphia Federal Reserve survey will draw the Treasury market's attention at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT. Economists predict a reading of 7.3 in June versus 1.6 in May for the survey of business conditions in the Philadelphia area.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Fed's survey is valuable because it offers an early glimpse of manufacturing activity in June, economists said. Other snapshots of June economic activity are provided by the Labor Department's weekly jobless claims and the weekly private surveys of chain store sales. Besides those items, the market must wait until the first week of July to get comprehensive reports on economic activity in June.  </p>
<p>If the economic data are unsurprising or friendly, the market could trade higher on technical grounds, said analysts at MMS International.</p>
<p>&quot;Technicals suggest a favorable trade if the contract can hold support at 112-00,&quot; said one analyst. &quot;Resistance is at 112-19 or 112-20.&quot;</p>
<p>At 0800 EDT/1200 GMT, the benchmark 30-year bond was priced at 99-4/32, down 2/32, to yield 6.69 percent.</p>
<p>Three-month Treasury bill rates were up one basis point to 4.94 percent. Six-month and year bill rates were unchanged at 5.07 percent and 5.33 percent, respectively.  </p>
<p>Two-year notes were unchanged at 100-14/32, yielding six percent.</p>
<p>The five-year note was down 1/32 to 100-28/32, yielding 6.29 percent.</p>
<p>The 10-year note was down 2/32 to 101-21/32, yielding 6.40 percent.</p>
