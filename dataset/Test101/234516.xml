<headline>GM demands huge damages from VW - report.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT, Germany</dateline>
<text>
<p>General Motors Corp. will demand at least 6 billion marks ($3.8 billion) in damages from rival Volkswagen AG in its U.S. lawsuit over allegations of industrial espionage, a magazine report said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Germany's Stern magazine said the provisional figure was reached by GM estimating that more than 4,000 pages of secret information with prices for about 110,000 car components were taken by top GM executives who quit in 1993 to join VW.</p>
<p>VW has vehemently denied the allegations.</p>
<p>If a U.S. jury were to rule in favour of GM and its German subsidiary Opel, a U.S. racketeering law being applied to the case would automatically triple any damages.</p>
<p>In Detroit, GM spokesman John Mueller said the automaker had not quantified any potential amounts because it did not know the extent of the alleged damages. &quot;We have from the outset not put a figure on that because the number will be developed during the course of the trial.&quot; &quot;We expect that amount to be substantial.&quot;</p>
<p>Previous published reports have put the damages that GM would seek at anywhere from a couple of hundred million dollars to up to $7.5 billion.</p>
<p>An Opel spokesman declined comment on the Stern report. Opel Chief Executive David Herman told Reuters Tuesday that the carmaker had not yet specified what it would seek from VW.</p>
<p>&quot;What the right amount will be is something that will come out of a full analysis of the facts, including the results of the discovery phase of the lawsuit,&quot; Herman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Stern said the data at the centre of the case helped VW, Europe's largest carmaker, cut annual costs by about four billion marks ($2.6 billion), saving the carmaker about 10 percent of the 40 billion marks ($25.6 billion) it spends each year on parts.</p>
<p>GM alleges that its former top purchasing executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, used the information to cut some 700 million marks ($448.2 million) of purchases at Volkswagen and quickly erode the 20 percent cost advantage Opel had over its German rival.</p>
<p>&quot;We have never charged that VW does not build good cars but that they had a cost problem and they solved that problem with our information,&quot; Stern quoted a GM official as saying.</p>
<p>Lopez resigned last Friday from the VW management board, with his lawyers saying he did so to prepare his defence.</p>
<p>Lopez and other top VW executives, including VW management board Chairman Ferdinand Piech, have been named as defendants in the U.S. lawsuit that alleges VW officials conspired to get the information as Lopez and seven other executives left GM.</p>
<p>Herbert Spohn, a spokesman for the Darmstadt public prosecutors' office near Frankfurt, told Reuters that no decision on whether to file charges against Lopez would be made this week but may come later this month.</p>
