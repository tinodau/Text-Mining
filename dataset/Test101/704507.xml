<p>A Moscow court has sentenced a former Russian diplomat to seven years hard labour for spying for the United States over a period of more than two decades, Itar-Tass news agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>It said Vasily Makarov was recruited by Washington's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1976 in Bolivia. Tass said he was found guilty of espionage at a trial last month but the details have only just been made public.</p>
<p>The news came a day after another Russian was jailed for 10 years for spying for Britain.</p>
<p>After his recruitment, Makarov worked for the CIA until his return to Moscow in 1979 and then again in Spain from 1989, Tass said.</p>
<p>Makarov, who was born in 1945, received more than $20,000 for his espionage work, it said.</p>
<p>Tass said the court's sentence, meted out on June 19, was relatively mild because of Makarov's &quot;candid repentance, his full acceptance of his guilt and his active cooperation with the investigation&quot;.</p>
<p>The court could not be reached for details. The U.S. embassy in Moscow was also not available for comment.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Russia's Supreme Court sentenced one-time Russian company manager Vadim Sintsov to 10 years hard labour after he pleaded guilty to providing British agents with information on the Russian arms industry.</p>
<p>Sintsov also received a lighter sentence than the maximum 20 years for &quot;cooperating with the court&quot;.</p>
<p>Tass said Makarov's trial had been the shortest of this year's espionage cases so far and had lasted just four days.</p>
<p>The trial was held behind closed doors and Tass did not say what secrets Makarov had divulged.</p>
<p>Russian security officials have recently warned that foreign spy services are stepping up their operations in the country, despite the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p>Senior officials from the FSB federal security service, successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said that in 1996 alone they uncovered 27 professional foreign spies and 60 Russian citizens working for foreign intelligence services.</p>
<p>A former Russian Foreign Ministry worker, Platon Obukhov, arrested last year on charges of spying for the British, is still awaiting trial.</p>
<p>Obukhov's family says the young man, who held a technical position in a crucial ministry department, was mentally unstable and should be treated by doctors rather then prosecuted.</p>
<p>Last month, FSB chief Nikolai Kovalyov called on foreign spies and their Russian operatives to call a hotline and become double agents. Kovalyov said last week the hotline had been a success and added, tantalisingly, that people would be surprised when he gave details.</p>
<p>Washington says Moscow is still active as well. An official at the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said earlier this year it was still investigating about 200 espionage cases and that resources spent on catching spies in Washington had increased since the Soviet Union's collapse.</p>
<p>Last month Harold Nicholson became the highest-ranking CIA officer ever indicted on espionage charges. He was sentenced to more than 23 years for spying for Russia since mid-1994.</p>
