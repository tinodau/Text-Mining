<headline>GM said to seek low price in new Brazil car.</headline>

<p>General Motors Corp plans to build a new low-cost car in Brazil that would sell for about $9,000 and utilize production techniques that maximize efficiency, industry analysts and two published reports said Monday.</p>
<p>GM's new car, code-named &quot;Blue Macaw,&quot; is expected to undercut the $11,000 price of Ford Motor Co's new Ka small car in Brazil, and Fiat SpA's Uno, currently the country's cheapest car at $10,000.  </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal and the trade weekly Automotive News quoted GM officials in Brazil as saying the new car will be built in a new, $600 million assembly plant that the company is building in southern part of the country.</p>
<p>With a such a low price -- including sales taxes -- GM hopes the car will open up a new market of consumers who previously could not afford to buy cars and trucks, the reports said.  </p>
<p>In addition to the GM assembly line, the plant will house about 20 outside suppliers that will build major parts sub-assemblies for the vehicle. Many of the concepts used were first developed by J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former GM purchasing chief who was accused of industrial espionage when he abruptly quit and joined Volkswagen AG in 1993.</p>
<p>Plans for Lopez' so-called Plant X were among the alleged documents that GM accused him of stealing and bringing to VW. The German automaker has built a plant using similar techniques in Resende, Brazil.  </p>
<p>GM officials in Detroit declined to comment on the reports and referred calls to the automaker's public relations office in Brazil, which did not return telephone calls on Monday.</p>
<p>GM is hosting hundreds of supplier executives in Rio de Janeiro for its annual Supplier of the Year awards ceremonies.</p>
<p>Michael Robinet, an automotive consultant with CSM Forecasting in Farmington Hills, Mich., said the Blue Macaw vehicle is based on GM's next-generation Opel Corsa platform. He described as a &quot;stripped-down Corsa.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This will meet the Ka on its own turf,&quot; said Robinet, who researches new product programs for automotive suppliers.</p>
