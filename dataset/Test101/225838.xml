<headline>VW sacrifices executive at centre of GM espionage feud.</headline>

<p>Volkswagen AG, cornered by adverse court rulings in its three-year legal fight with General Motors, on Friday sacrificed its production chief in a possible first step towards ending the row.</p>
<p>Volkswagen said its supervisory board had accepted the immediate resignation of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the cost-cutting crusader at the centre of industrial spying allegations.</p>
<p>&quot;The supervisory board acceded to the request of Mr Lopez at today's meeting and agreed to end his contract as management board member with effect from November 29,&quot; the carmaker said a brief statement released during a supervisory board meeting.</p>
<p>VW's supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen would make a short statement at the start of a news conference at 1530 GMT, VW said. A spokesman declined to comment on whether a successor to Lopez had been appointed.</p>
<p>VW has consistently denied accusations by GM and its German unit Adam Opel AG that Lopez and three other former GM executives now at VW stole boxes of secret documents and computer disks on purchasing and car production plans when they defected to VW in early 1993.</p>
<p>Lawyers representing Lopez said in a statement that he had asked to leave VW to concentrate on his defence and to fulfil a long-standing dream to set up a consultancy firm for industrial purchasing.</p>
<p>Lopez had been widely expected to offer his resignation and the supervisory board, keen to end a battle which threatens to cost VW billions of dollars and do irreparable harm to its reputation, had been expected to accept.</p>
<p>Pressure on VW to reach an out-of-court settlement rose sharply on Tuesday when a U.S. district judge in Detroit, GM's home town, ruled GM could pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and other VW executives, including VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech.</p>
<p>Allowing the legal action to proceed under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO), which has been widely used to prosecute the mafia, trebles the amount of compensation VW would have to pay if found guilty.</p>
<p>Industry sources say VW may have to pay billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Opel this week demanded that VW sack Lopez, apologise publicly and pay compensation in return for an out-of-court deal. Sources close to Opel said on Friday that Lopez's resignation alone was not enough.</p>
<p>But VW, led by Piech, has given Lopez its full backing throughout the bitter dispute.</p>
<p>In Friday's statement, the supervisory board expressly thanked Lopez for his &quot;excellent&quot; work.</p>
<p>Lopez, a Basque renowned for his ability to streamline production and cut carmaking costs, established innovative working practices at VW that helped return it to profitability.</p>
<p>But media reports have speculated that Piech's own future may also be in doubt if the court action goes ahead.</p>
<p>Both VW and Opel have officially denied media reports that they have been negotiating an out-of-court settlement, but sources close to GM said VW supervisory board chairman Liesen had made contact with GM over the matter.</p>
<p>The sources said GM did not expect Piech to back down but expected some movement from VW's supervisory board.</p>
<p>The U.S. court decision was the latest in a series of blows for VW.</p>
<p>Last week a Frankfurt court decided to hand over German prosecution documents on VW to the U.S. Justice Department, which is conducting its own investigation and requested the papers more than two years ago.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lopez' own lawyers have said they expect German prosecutors to file criminal charges of industrial spying in a German court by the end of November.</p>
<p>And a Frankfurt judge last month dismissed a VW lawsuit charging Opel with defamation. VW plans to appeal.</p>
