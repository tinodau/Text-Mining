<p>Shares in Volkswagen AG -- Europe's largest carmaker -- extended losses on Wednesday, falling almost six percent after a U.S. judge on Tuesday denied VW's attempt to dismiss racketeering claims by rival Opel AG.</p>
<p>The ruling could open VW to potentially higher damages in a lawsuit with Opel, the German unit of U.S. carmaker General Motors Corp, over alleged industrial espionage.</p>
<p>VW shares fell as much as 38 marks to 601 marks before recovering slightly to trade at 604.50 marks at midday.</p>
<p>Dealers did not want to talk of an accelerating sell-off since trading volumes were not high enough.</p>
<p>Analysts at Dresdner Bank said a drop in VW shares to 600 marks should be used as an opportunity to buy the stock, which first topped the 600 mark level on October 30.</p>
<p>The broader German share market was slightly weaker, with the 30-share DAX index of German shares, which includes VW, down 0.45 percent at 2,797.90 points.</p>
<p>In addition, VW shares were under pressure after VW said it would decide on Monday whether to introduce short-time working hours at its main plant in Wolfsburg because the supply of car parts has been affected by a French trucker strike.</p>
<p>But traders said the threat of hefty damages in the U.S. lawsuit filed by Opel and parent company General Motors was the primary reason for the stocks's drop.</p>
<p>In New York, GM shares closed up $1/8 at $58-3/8 in an overall weaker market after the news.</p>
<p>Dealers emphasised the fact that VW shares reached a year high of 645 marks in computer dealings on Tuesday and said the current fall could in part be put down to the share price correcting after its recent rally.</p>
<p>VW shares have been one a one-way upward path, gaining almost 30 percent, since late July when the stock was at a low of 498 marks.</p>
<p>Analysts said that although damages could be more than expected, VW should not suffer too much.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see VW's image being hit by any verdict. They will keep doing what they are doing,&quot; said Peter Schmidt, analyst at Automotive Industry Data in Britain.</p>
<p>&quot;It could potentially be damaging but it should blow over and the public really doesn't care because it doesn't affect how a VW performs on the road,&quot; Schmidt added.</p>
