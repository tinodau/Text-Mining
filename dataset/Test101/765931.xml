<p>Russian spycatchers have identified 1,200 foreign spies or foreigners suspected of spying in the past three years, Interfax news agency quoted a senior counter-intelligence official as saying on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The unnamed official told Interfax that in the same period 130 illegal operations by foreign secret services had been disclosed and 52 foreign spies had been expelled.</p>
<p>He also said 46 Russian citizens who cooperated with foreign intelligence services had been detected and arrested.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Russia's Federal Security Service, which leads the country's fight against espionage, declined to comment on the report.</p>
<p>The official quoted by Interfax hailed as a huge counter-intelligence success the arrest in early 1996 of a junior foreign ministry official, Platon Obukhov, who faces charges of spying for Britain's MI6 foreign intelligence.</p>
<p>&quot;Obukhov's arrest has been the biggest failure of MI6 since Oleg Penkovsky,&quot; he said referring to a Soviet colonel executed in 1963 for passing secrets to Britain through businessman Greville Wynne.</p>
<p>The official said that following Obukhov's arrest 14 MI6 officers had been disclosed and forced to leave Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;The MI6 has been actually forced to stop its active work in Russia,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday Russian judges ruled that Obukhov, 28, was mentally unstable and needed psychiatric treatment. They decided to return to his case when he feels better.</p>
<p>Obukhov's lawyer and parents insist that he has been mentally unstable since childhood, including the period when he is said to had spied for Britain. They insist that all charges against him be dropped.</p>
<p>The prosecution says he was sane when dealing with the British agents and should sooner or later answer for high treason in court.</p>
<p>The counter-intelligence official told Interfax that a senior officer of the Mossad Israeli intelligence service had been seized red-handed in Moscow when trying to receive materials from an agent and expelled.</p>
<p>&quot;For the time being Mossad activities in Russia have been halted,&quot; the official said.</p>
<p>Russian counter-intelligence officials have said that MI6 and Mossad were the best-run spy agencies they had to deal with even though they were far smaller that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
<p>Earlier this year two Russians were tried in court and found guilty of spying for Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>The official told Interfax that more spy stories were still ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;A number of operations involving foreign citizens who are spying against Russia are under way now,&quot; he said. &quot;But it is too early to name the names.&quot;</p>
<p>Russian counter-intelligence officials have said that foreign secret services have stepped up their activities in Russia after the euphoria of the West's honeymoon with the post-Soviet Kremlin started fading.</p>
<p>Last month counter-intelligence chief Nikolai Kovalyov set up a telephone number inviting all Russians working for foreign spy agencies to call and confess in exchange for a promise that they would not be charged.</p>
<p>Kovalyov later said that the hot line was a huge success but gave no details.</p>
