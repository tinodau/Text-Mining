<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Monday.</p>
<p>LONDON - Market holiday. On Friday. The FTSE 100 index added 10.6 points to close at 4,455.6.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Germany's blue-chip DAX index rallied to end bourse trade at a new all-time closing high on Monday, with sentiment cheered by Wall Street's strong gains on Friday and the dollar's ongoing resilience at higher levels.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX comfortably exceeded a previous record high of 3,474.28 points to end bourse up 68.41 points, or nearly two percent at 3,528.78 points, just off an all-time high of 3,533.18 points reached earlier in the session. In post-bourse trade the DAX stood at 3565.69 up 74.61 points.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares closed higher, supported by a rising Wall Street, traders said. But trading in Paris suffered from low volume as London was closed for a market holiday.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 17.53 points or 0.66 percent at 2,672.84, while the CAC-40 futures contract was up 24 at 2,662 from Friday's close.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares powered ahead on Monday to end above the psycologically important level of 5,000 points in the blue chip Swiss Market Index (SMI), posting the fourth record close in as many days.</p>
<p>SMI closed higher by 76.1 points or 1.54 percent at 5,029.6. The index earlier hit an all-time high at 5,041.5.</p>
<p>All-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI) ended up 43.09 points or 1.38 percent at 3,170.56.</p>

<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks raced ahead on Monday to close sharply higher after a strong rally on Wall Street on Friday spurred heavy buying in interest rate sensitive property and banking stocks.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index jumped 317.64 points, or 2.43 percent, to 13,399.34 after touching a session high at 13,439.78.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Early enthusiasm for Australian shares faded by the close on Monday as market bellwether BHP lost all of its early gains in afternoon trade after unions voted for a nationwide strike against BHP on May 15.</p>
<p>At close the All Ordinaries index ended 1.1 points higher at 2,492.7 after hitting an intra-day high of 2,509.9, but never built enough momentum to topple the record high of 2515.1 reached last Wednesday.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African gold shares ended firm after bullion rose three dollars to around $343 an ounce, dealers said.</p>
<p>The gold index ended up 24.1 points at 1,205.7 points, lifting the index from the four year lows it has been plumbing in the last few sessions.</p>
<p>The industrial index gained 24.9 points to 8,563.4 points and the all-share index was 41.4 points stronger at 7,190.4 points.</p>
