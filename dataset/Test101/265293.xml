<title>GERMANY: VW no comment on GM talks report.</title>
<headline>VW no comment on GM talks report.</headline>

<p>Germany's Volkswagen AG on Wednesday declined to comment on a report that it may meet soon with U.S. rival General Motors Corp to attempt to resolve their industrial espionage dispute.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal Europe, quoting sources close to GM, said talks between the car giants were expected to resume quickly and a settlement could soon follow.</p>
<p>A spokesman for VW said the car-maker did not wish to comment.</p>
<p>VW and GM have been locked in battle over allegations that GM's former purchasing manager Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua stole company secrets when he switched from GM to VW in 1993.</p>
<p>Lopez faces a grand jury investigation by prosecutors in Detroit -- proceedings VW hopes to avoid by reaching an out-of-court settlement.</p>
<p>Attempts at reconciliation have so far failed as VW has not met GM's conditions, which are that it sever ties with Lopez, admit wrongdoing and pay damages.</p>
<p>VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech last week expressed his &quot;deepest regrets&quot; for the events surrounding the dispute but said he would not apologise directly. GM said this was not enough.</p>
<p>German press reports last week said top executives from VW and GM would meet this week to try to resolve the crisis.</p>
<p>The daily Die Welt reported that VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen and Lower Saxony state premier Gerhard Schroeder would meet with GM executives John Smale and Thomas Wyman.</p>
<p>The newspaper also said VW might attempt to win GM over to an out-of-court settlement by offering to help the U.S. carmaker develop business in China -- a country where VW already has a strong presence.</p>
<p>Lopez quit VW in late November to prepare his legal defence, but VW has said it may still work with Lopez on consulting projects.</p>
<p>Lopez's problems would not be entirely averted even if a deal were made with GM. German prosecutors have filed criminal charges against him and three other executives for embezzlement and betrayal of corporate secrets.</p>
