<p>Volkswagen AG and U.S. giant General Motors Corp, ending one of the bitterest battles in corporate history, reached an out-of-court deal on Thursday over alleged industrial espionage by GM executives who moved to VW.</p>
<p>VW, Europe's largest carmaker, said it had agreed to pay $100 million to GM, whose German unit Adam Opel AG is VW's biggest rival in Europe, and acknowledged there might have been wrongdoing by the individuals who quit GM to join VW in 1993.</p>
<p>Both sides agreed to drop all legal actions against each other and VW committed itself to buy GM parts worth $1 billion over a seven-year period.</p>
<p>The deal, hammered out in Detroit during secret talks held this week, brought to an end a nearly four-year-old dispute and removed VW from the risk of facing a multi-billion dollar U.S. jury verdict in a civil lawsuit filed by GM last March.</p>
<p>Both carmakers said in joint statement they looked forward to &quot;a future unencumbered by the legacy of this matter&quot;.</p>
<p>In a letter to GM which forms part of the settlement, VW confirmed that it had accepted the resignation of the figure at the centre of the dispute, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a 55-year-old Spaniard, and also those who followed him to VW.</p>
<p>VW, in accepting that GM's actions were &quot;not designed to harm Volkswagen's image,&quot; also retracted statements made by company officials that included allegations GM employees may have tampered with evidence later collected by prosecutors.</p>
<p>Previous secret talks to end the dispute had failed as the two carmakers argued over what public statements must be made by VW officials to end the fight, industry sources said.</p>
<p>VW in 1993 had lured Lopez away from GM and named him to the VW management board. He quickly fulfilled his reputation as a tough cost-cutter by slicing around one billion marks ($635 million) out of VW operations, helping the carmaker to return to profitability.</p>
<p>But GM accused him of industrial espionage, alleging he had used the strategic documents to blunt GMs ompetitive cost advantage against the Wolfsburg-based carmaker and filed the Detroit lawsuit after saying the German probe was too slow.</p>
<p>The Detroit lawsuit, which named VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech as a defendant, alleged that Lopez stole thousands of GM documents on a new factory, parts data and cost data for GM vehicles both existing and under development.</p>
<p>GM had long held the upper hand in the dispute, repeatedly calling on VW to fire Lopez and his associates as well as to issue a public apology and agree to charges before a settlement deal could be reached -- all fulfilled in the settlement.</p>
<p>Lopez resigned from the VW board last November, only a few days before German prosecutors filed criminal charges against him and three of his associates who had followed him to VW.</p>
<p>Of those three managers, one has already quit VW and the two others will resign or take administrative leave as part of the settlement announced late on Thursday.</p>
<p>VW also said it &quot;acknowledges the possibility that illegal activities by the individuals may have occurred. These allegations remain to be proven or disproven&quot;.</p>
<p>But VW added that it respected the individuals' right to be considered innocent until proven guilty.</p>
<p>VW shares ended 27 marks higher in Frankfurt on Thursday at a record high of 706.90 marks on speculation that a settlement was imminent. ($1=1.5711 Mark)</p>
