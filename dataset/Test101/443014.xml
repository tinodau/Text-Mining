<p>Former Volkswagen AG executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua said industrial espionage charges against him were a &quot;manipulated controversy&quot; in an interview published Friday by USA Today.</p>
<p>The newspaper, which spoke to Lopez after a conference in Amsterdam, said he sounded confident about his ability to overcome his legal problems and about his new management consulting firm, Lopez de Arriortua &amp; Co.</p>
<p>&quot;This is all...manipulated controversy, artificial controversy,&quot; Lopez said. &quot;We have no fear. We have more clients than we can use.&quot;  </p>
<p>German prosecutors in December charged Lopez and three VW associates with stealing trade secrets from General Motors Corp. when they left the Detroit-based automaker to join VW in March 1993. Lopez, credited with cutting purchasing costs at both automakers, resigned from VW in November.</p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department is continuing an investigation that could result in criminal charges against Lopez and his followers. GM dropped a civil racketeering suit against Lopez as part of a $1.1 billion settlement that also called for VW to sever its ties to Lopez.  </p>
<p>Asked if the turmoil has ruined his reputation, Lopez compared himself to General Electric Co Chairman Jack Welch, who overcame a reputation for ruthless cost-cutting to become one of the world's most revered corporate executives.</p>
<p>&quot;Jack Welch is doing an excellent job today. But some days, he was in the press very often, and nasty things were said about him,&quot; Lopez said. &quot;But he had a clear vision. He said to the people, 'Don't look back, don't look at politics, make your company without boundaries.' Now he demonstrates that he was all right.&quot;</p>
<p>Consultants can't &quot;be in the position of Jack Welch. But I will try to do my best,&quot; Lopez told USA Today.</p>
<p>Lopez de Arriortua &amp; Co already has conducted a dozen turnaround seminars for clients in Europe, and Lopez said U.S. companies have shown interest.</p>
<p>But the newspaper said he smiled and shrugged when asked if he would travel to the United States to conduct a seminar. He has not set foot on U.S. soil since he left GM four years ago.</p>
