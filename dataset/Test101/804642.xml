<p>The lawyer for an Israeli man charged with spying in Egypt tried on Sunday to prove his client innocent by blasting prosecution evidence against his alleged Egyptian accomplice.</p>
<p>Farid el-Deeb, lawyer for Israeli Druze textile engineer Azam Azam, raised questions about the sequence of events leading to Emad Ismail's alleged recruitment by the Israeli secret service Mossad.</p>
<p>Azam and Ismail are charged with making criminal arrangements to spy in Egypt for Mossad. They have pleaded not guilty. Two women -- Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna -- are on trial in absentia for the same charges.</p>
<p>In Sunday's session, Deeb highlighted inconsistencies in the prosecution case against Ismail.</p>
<p>He told the court that Ismail's alleged confession said he signed a cooperation form with a Mossad agent on May 25, 1996. However Deeb claimed interrogation reports showed that Ismail had said he agreed to work for Mossad the following month.</p>
<p>Among the charges levelled against Ismail was that he provided information on Egypt's industry to Mossad.</p>
<p>But Deeb said such information was easy to obtain and presented to the judge free government publications on factories in new satellite cities.</p>
<p>According to investigators, Azam is alleged to have given Ismail women's underwear marked with Mossad's invisible ink to take into Egypt.</p>
<p>Deeb said expert testimony on the alleged invisible ink was inconsistent.</p>
<p>Deeb added that Ismail had also filed a complaint against torture, saying he had written to the judge in February on an empty cigarette packet.</p>
<p>When asked by his lawyer and the judge, Maharram Darwish, Ismail confirmed he wrote the note.</p>
<p>In the complaint, Ismail said: &quot;I am subjected to the ugliest forms of torture, which lead to slow death.</p>
<p>&quot;It includes solitary confinement for 105 days till now (February)... scarce food, drink and medicine, the refusal to go to the toilet or to leave my cell for more than 24 hours.&quot;</p>
<p>The two defendants, handcuffed to policemen, stood silently in the courtroom cage during the State Security Court trial.</p>
<p>Asaad Asaad, a prominent Druze figure and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's adviser, and Israeli diplomats in Cairo attended the session.</p>
<p>The hearing resumes on Monday.</p>
