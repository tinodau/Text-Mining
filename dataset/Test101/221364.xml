<p>Volkswagen Wednesday rejected a demand by rival carmaker Opel, the German unit of General Motors Corp., that a top VW executive at the centre of industrial espionage charges be removed from his job.</p>
<p>Opel said production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua would have to be dismissed before it would consider an out-of-court settlement of the dispute.</p>
<p>But a VW spokesman rejected the demand as unacceptable and said any talks over a deal in the U.S. lawsuit filed by Opel and GM against Volkswagen would require no preconditions.</p>
<p>Opel's demand that Lopez be fired came after a U.S. judge in Detroit, the hometown of GM, decided to allow the carmaker to pursue racketeering charges against the executive and other VW bosses, including management board Chairman Ferdinand Piech.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no dismissal of Mr. Lopez,&quot; VW spokesman Klaus Kocks told Reuters. &quot;Where there is no damage, there can be no compensation.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. court decision pushed shares in VW -- Europe's largest carmaker -- down almost 6 percent on Wednesday. VW ended down 37.75 marks ($24.75) at 601.25 marks ($394.26).</p>
<p>Opel dismissed speculation that it was already in talks with VW to reach a deal on the lawsuit. It not only demanded that Lopez go before relations could be improved, but also reiterated other demands first laid out in August 1993 after Lopez left GM for VW. These include a public apology by top VW executives and an unspecified payment for damages.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than take these necessary steps, Volkswagen management has continued to deny any wrongdoing and has supported Lopez by retaining him as a senior member of management,&quot; Opel said.</p>
<p>Germany's Spiegel magazine reported last weekend that the carmakers were in talks to settle the lawsuit linked to Lopez and other former Opel executives now at VW, who allegedly stole secret documents before they left.</p>
<p>Spiegel said VW supervisory board Chairman Klaus Liesen and GM Chairman John Smale had recently met in Detroit to consider a possible out-of-court settlement.</p>
<p>Opel said it was not its policy to comment on the status of confidential talks but felt obliged &quot;to correct misleading information that has been disseminated to the public.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are currently no settlement negotiations in progress between Opel and GM and Volkswagen,&quot; Opel said.</p>
<p>Mounting speculation about a deal comes after GM and Opel have racked up a series of courtroom victories in recent weeks against VW and Lopez and strong comments from management at both carmakers about their willingness to pursue VW and Lopez.</p>
<p>Lopez's lawyer has said he expected German prosecutors to file criminal charges against his client soon, which would be another black eye for VW as it seeks to maintain profits in a difficult European automobile market.</p>
<p>In addition, a U.S. grand jury in Detroit will soon have the chance to review documents from the German investigation after a Frankfurt court last Friday approved the transfer of the documents to the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI.</p>
<p>Volkswagen downplayed the impact of the Detroit ruling.</p>
<p>&quot;This has nothing to do with the merits of the allegations, but merely whether they are legally sufficient, being taken as true, to state a claim,&quot; VW quoted its U.S. lawyer as saying.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds said in a written order that GM's complaint alleging that VW stole confidential documents adequately met the standard needed to proceed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act.</p>
<p>If a jury finds VW damaged GM, VW could be forced to pay out triple the amount of damages, according to the RICO law.</p>
<p>The statute, which has been widely used to prosecute organised crime in the United States, requires proof of an ongoing conspiracy or enterprise that aims to commit fraud or other criminal acts.</p>
<p>Under the RICO law, GM claimed that Lopez, Piech and other executives were in a conspiracy to steal important documents on strategy, pricing and manufacturing techniques and transport them to Germany.</p>
