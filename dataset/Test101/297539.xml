<headline>GM, VW in talks to settle dispute, source says.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT, Germany</dateline>
<text>
<p>General Motors Corp. and Volkswagen AG have been holding secret talks to solve their dispute over the U.S. carmaker's claims of industrial spying by its German rival, according to a source familiar with the situation.</p>
<p>The source, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters Thursday there has been &quot;real progress in settlement discussions&quot; in the case over allegations that a former GM executive and his associates stole documents when they left to join VW in 1993.</p>
<p>The talks began in early January, the source said.</p>
<p>Hans Wilhelm Gaeb, a vice president at GM's European headquarters Zurich, refused to comment on any talks between the two carmakers.</p>
<p>The source said a settlement could be announced as soon as Friday. A key part of the talks had been VW's agreement to retract statements made about GM and its Opel German unit and the carmakers' alleged attempt to damage Germany as an industrial centre.</p>
<p>GM had also moderated its stance in the dispute.</p>
<p>GM and Opel have been at odds since Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and a group of former executives left GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG, in March 1993 to join VW.</p>
<p>GM charged that Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, took along thousands of secret GM documents that helped VW return to profitability and blunted GM's competitive edge.</p>
<p>Lopez quit VW in late November, shortly before criminal fraud charges were filed against him and three of his associates by German prosecutors.</p>
<p>Previous attempts to settle a lawsuit GM brought against VW in a Detroit federal court charging the German carmaker with racketeering have failed, in part because VW refused to retract statements made by top company officials.</p>
