<title>GERMANY: VW sticks by chief Piech after GM settlement.</title>
<headline>VW sticks by chief Piech after GM settlement.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT, Germany</dateline>

<p>Volkswagen AG reaffirmed its confidence in chief executive Ferdinand Piech Sunday and pledged to extend his contract after the company last week settled a four-year-old feud with General Motors Corp.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper, VW supervisory board head Klaus Liesen said: &quot;Piech helped to bring about the settlement and was fully behind carrying it through. There is no doubt that his contract will be extended.&quot;</p>
<p>Liesen's comments echoed fellow supervisory board member Gerhard Schroeder, who told the Koelner Stadt-Anzeiger on Saturday that Piech would stay with VW and said the German automaker's management was not to blame for the dispute with GM.</p>
<p>VW averted a potentially costly U.S. jury ruling on Thursday when it settled its battle with GM over charges that Jose Ignacio Lopez had stolen industrial secrets when he defected to VW in 1993.</p>
<p>VW agreed to pay GM $100 million in compensation, buy $1 billion worth of GM parts over the next seven years and retract statements such as charges that GM may have tampered with evidence before it was released to German prosecutors.</p>
<p>In return, GM agreed to drop its U.S. lawsuit in a Detroit federal court based on racketeering laws.</p>
<p>Relief that the dispute was over has been tempered in Germany by worries over the cost of the deal. Some shareholders warned this weekend that Piech and other top executives would face a grilling at the next shareholder meeting.</p>
<p>But supervisory board member Schroeder denied that the VW management had acted wrongly in the dispute.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not feel damaged in any way. All decisions were agreed unanimously by the VW board and I have no reason to doubt these decisions in hindsight,&quot; Schroeder was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>VW said in December that it planned to extend Piech's contract, which expires on Jan., 1, 1998. Welt am Sonntag said an official ruling likely to extend it to 2003 would be made at a supervisory board meeting on March 21.</p>
