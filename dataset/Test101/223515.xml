<p>German carmaker Volkswagen AG's share price has suffered lately, hurt by the row between VW and GM 's Adam Opel, but analysts say it could gain new life if production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arritortua resigns.</p>
<p>Sources close to VW said on Thursday that Lopez was likely to resign on Friday. Lopez is the key figure in a three-year legal battle with General Motors over allegations of industrial espionage.</p>
<p>Ironically, news that the feted cost-cutter was leaving VW boosted its shares by almost two percent on Thursday. Dealers said hopes that his departure could defuse the dispute with GM far outweighed worries about the loss of Lopez as a manager.</p>
<p>&quot;This looks like it could be the first step towards a proper settlement and I think the market would react positively were Lopez to step down,&quot; said Timo Graucob, motor industry analyst at Hypo Bank in Munich.</p>
<p>Josh Waiblinger, of BHF Bank's Institutional Investor department, said: &quot;If Lopez leaves, then the measures he has introduced will stay behind him. His resignation would be positive for the share price -- I think the current negotiations are all about saving face.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If there wasn't such a huge amount of investors' money being destroyed on the markets because of this row, then I would describe the whole thing as a farce,&quot; said Waiblinger.</p>
<p>Volkswagen shares have had a good run over the last four years. In January 1992 the share stood at around 300 marks, falling below 300 marks in January 1993 when the company reported operating losses of 1.636 billion marks ($1.07 billion) and the legal row first reared its head.</p>
<p>Since then the share price has risen strongly despite a dip in July of this year to 498 marks, when the U.S. aspect of the legal battle surfaced.</p>
<p>However, news from the U.S. on Tuesday that VW could be open to potentially higher damages on charges of racketeering saw the stock fall nearly six percent to 601 marks.</p>
<p>The share recovered thereafter as rumours of a settlement grew. VW shares closed bourse trade at 613 marks on Thursday, up 11.75 marks, but still well off a year high of 642.50 marks.</p>
<p>&quot;I can definitely imagine that Lopez will step down and I think that would be a good solution for the company and that we could then see an out-of-court agreeement,&quot; said Graucob.</p>
<p>But patience is not limitless on the floor of the Frankfurt bourse, where traders are getting impatient.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't want this to go on too long. If they don't get an agreement soon, the share could go below 600 marks, maybe down to 575 marks,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Recent days have seen huge chunks of Volkswagen market capitalisation destroyed as market players seek to quantify the damage that could be done to Volkswagen if the U.S. court sides with Opel on the racketeering charge.</p>
<p>Analysts and traders alike are loath to put a number on the amount that VW would have to pay in an out-of-court settlement, but the figures are generally in the billions of marks. If the company loses its court case, the figure could triple.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at what has happened to the share this week -- 1.4 billion marks in market cap was wiped out yesterday -- then I think you could say that 60 or 70 percent of a potential payout has been discounted,&quot; said Waiblinger.</p>
<p>Graucob said: &quot;The case has already taken three years to get to trial, and the trial will run and run and no-one but the lawyers is going to get rich on the back of a case like this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Two years ago it would have been a disaster. He's a very competent manager and it is a pity to change a top manager out of the team, but if he stays it could ultimately damage the company,&quot; said Graucob. ($1=1.5330 Mark)</p>
