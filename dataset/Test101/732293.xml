<p>The death toll from a capsized ferry on Indonesia's scenic Lake Toba in North Sumatra rose to 82 after rescue officials found four more bodies, the official Antara news Agency reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;The search and rescue team found another four bodies on Wednesday morning,&quot; Antara said. The ferry K.M. Pedaltari capsized on Sunday. Antara said rescue officials continued their search as 108 people had been recorded as missing.</p>
<p>Rescue officials said more than 150 people were believed to have been on the small wooden ferry, which had a maximum legal capacity of between 50 and 60 people.</p>
<p>It said the ferry's captain, Opo Sihotang, was among the missing people, either because he had drowned or had fled.</p>
<p>Antara quoted a member of an amateur radio organisation as saying about 50 passengers had swum to safety.</p>
<p>The Kompas daily said villages in the Lake Toba region were in mourning, with red flags flying as a sign that somebody had died.</p>
<p>Police said the passengers were returning to their homes on Samosir Island after attending a cultural festival in Parapat on the shore of the lake.</p>
<p>No foreigners were among the passengers, police said.</p>
<p>Antara quoted survivors as saying they heard loud cracking noises before the boat sank and that water quickly flooded into the boat.</p>
