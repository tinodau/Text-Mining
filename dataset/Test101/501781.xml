<headline>VW says VW, Audi among top pft contributors.</headline>

<p>Volkswagen AG said on Thursday its Volkswagen and Audi AG brands, along with its Volkswagen financial services unit, were the top contributors to its 1996 group net profit of 678 million marks.</p>
<p>Volkswagen chief executive Ferdinand Piech said in the text of a speech at the German carmaker's annual news conference that growth in volume sales was a major factor for the higher profits, which were backed by a 10.7 percent increase in group vehicle deliveries to 3.994 million units last year.</p>
<p>The German carmaker earlier this year said its group profit nearly doubled to 678 million marks from 336 million marks in 1995 behind a 10.6 percent growth in group sales to 3.977 billion marks.</p>
<p>Piech also said VW's troubled Seat Spanish subsidiary reported a profit in 1996 for the first time since 1993, in part due to what he called &quot;special factors&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Further efforts are required to keep Seat in the profit zone,&quot; Piech said.</p>
<p>VW's Skoda Czech unit also reported positive results for last year, Piech said.</p>
<p>In addition, Piech said VW has decided its Europcar vehicle rental unit was &quot;no longer a burden&quot; for VW after &quot;considerable discussions&quot; last year about whether to sell the troubled unit in which it has a 50 percent stake.</p>
<p>VW said in its annual report that Europcar reduced its losses in 1996 to about one million marks from 40 million marks in 1996 through changes in fleet management, cost-saving measures and higher sales in Spain, France and Portugual.</p>
<p>&quot;A return to profits is expected for 1997,&quot; VW said of the Europcar unit in the annual report.</p>
