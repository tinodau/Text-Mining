<p>The head of the U.S. Senate intelligence committee said on Thursday he believed an FBI agent arrested for allegedly selling national security secrets to Russia had caused &quot;considerable&quot; damage.</p>
<p>&quot;Considerable. But the full extent of the damage won't be known for some time,&quot; said Sen. Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican.</p>
<p>The FBI arrested Earl Edwin Pitts on Wednesday for allegedly selling secrets to Russia since 1987 for more than $224,000 in the second spy case to erupt in a month.</p>
<p>The FBI said the arrest of Pitts, a 13-year veteran, capped a 16-month undercover operation, with U.S. agents posing as Russian spies and the use of a former Russian officer at the United Nations in New York who later became an FBI informant.</p>
<p>Specter told NBC's &quot;Today&quot; programme he was satisfied with the security checks the U.S. government had in place while it pursued Pitts.</p>
<p>&quot;The FBI and the CIA both are very sensitive now to spies. After the Aldrich Ames case, a great deal is being done that wasn't being done before,&quot; said Specter. &quot;They're working very hard.&quot;</p>
<p>Specter noted that it was &quot;impossible to know what you don't know. But it is entirely conceivable that there are more spies and they're trying very hard to ferret them out.&quot;</p>
<p>FBI Director Louis Freeh said on Wednesday the Pitts case did not appear to be as damaging as that involving Aldrich Ames, the confessed CIA turncoat arrested in 1994 for betraying numerous agents and passing along some of the nation's most sensitive secrets.</p>
<p>The Pitts incident was the second spy case to rock Washington and Moscow in a month. The FBI on Nov. 18 arrested veteran CIA officer Harold Nicholson on charges of spying for Russia.</p>
