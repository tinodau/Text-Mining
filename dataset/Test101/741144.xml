<p>The lawyer for an Israeli man charged with spying in Egypt said on Saturday that the real motive in the case was to stop the normalisation of Egyptian-Israeli relations.</p>
<p>&quot;Is there really an espionage case? The case is meant to stop normalisation,&quot; Farid el-Deeb, lawyer for Israeli Druze textile engineer Azam Azam, said during a session of his trial.</p>
<p>Azam and Egyptian worker Emad Abdelhalim Ismail are charged with making criminal arrangements to spy in Egypt for Israel's secret service, Mossad. They have pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Two women -- Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna -- are on trial in absentia for the same charges.</p>
<p>The case, which began on April 24, brought Egypt-Israeli ties to one of their lowest ebbs since their 1979 peace treaty.</p>
<p>Relations have also been strained since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took power in 1996 and the peace process stalled between Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
<p>&quot;The unfair (Egyptian) media campaign regarded Azam as a symbol,&quot; Deeb said in a two-hour speech in which he called on Netanyahu to &quot;refrain from militancy and arbitrariness...and let the peace process progress&quot;.</p>
<p>The two defendants, handcuffed to policemen, stood silently in a courtroom cage during the State Security Court trial, which will resume on Sunday.</p>
<p>According to investigators, Azam is alleged to have given Ismail women's underwear marked with Mossad's invisible ink to take into Egypt.</p>
<p>Published accounts of Ismail's confession say he was blackmailed into working for Mossad by explicit pictures of his love affair with Greiss and that Shawahna offered him $1,000 to work for Israeli intelligence.</p>
<p>Originally the two men were charged with economic spying.</p>
<p>In May, state prosecutors introduced a criminal espionage charge, saying Azam made a criminal agreement with Ismail and the two Israeli women to spy for Mossad. Deeb on Saturday rejected the new charge because the case had already opened.</p>
<p>He also questioned procedures of the investigation. &quot;Reports of Emad's interrogations do not say when they ended. And two men, Mickey Baghoth and Maher el-Nemr, were named in the reports as Mossad agents. Why were they not included like Mona and Zahra?&quot;</p>
<p>Deeb said Ismail's confession contained only details of his affairs. He objected that the authority which arrested Emad and Azam also carried out tests and checked the suspected material.</p>
<p>&quot;I myself bought invisible ink for one Egyptian pound. It is available on the market,&quot; Deeb said.</p>
<p>It is not clear what the maximum penalty is for the men.</p>
<p>Deeb has said his client faced a maximum 15 years in prison with hard labour while Ismail could be given a life sentence because he was a civil servant. Ahmed Bakr, Ismail's lawyer, has said both faced a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.</p>
<p>Asaad Asaad, a prominent Druze figure and Netanyahu adviser, and Israel's consul in Cairo, Eli Levy, attended the session.</p>
