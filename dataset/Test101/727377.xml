<p>Technical analysis suggests the spread between 10-year Italian and German government bond yields has crashed through key support levels and will shrink rapidly in the near term, chartists said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;The BTP/Bund spread has continued its very sharp narrowing trend, and we have broken through some significant levels in the last week,&quot; said Ian Stannard, technical analyst at Chase in London. &quot;We are targeting 76 basis points over the next couple of weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>The BTP/Bund spread has swung in at a furious rate, from 155 basis points in early June to 91 basis points on Monday.</p>
<p>The breakthrough has been on the back of a growing belief that Italy will join the European single currency with the first wave of entrants in 1999, economists said.</p>
<p>But technical analysts find the BTP/Bund spread charts offer at least as strong an argument for the spread to come in further.</p>
<p>&quot;We have broken down out of channel support on daily closing charts,&quot; said Elizabeth Miller, technical analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London.</p>
<p>Parallel trendlines drawn from the 222 basis point peak in the BTP/Bund spread, reached in mid-March, throw up a key technical level at around 98 basis points.</p>
<p>&quot;We have broken through that, and it has now become resistance,&quot; said Stannard.</p>
<p>Miller at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, like Stannard, found the next key support well below current levels .</p>
<p>&quot;We are moving down towards 73 basis points, which is an Elliott wave swing target.&quot;</p>
<p>Elliott wave theory holds that a market follows a repetitive pattern consisting of five waves one way followed by a three wave correction.</p>
<p>Technical indicators also suggest the spread is destined for further narrowing, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The RSI has broken through support at 27.00, and is currently around 25.00 percent,&quot; said Stannard.</p>
<p>RSI, Relative Strength Index, is used to identify when an instrument is overbought or oversold. A reading below 30 percent suggests an oversold instrument.</p>
<p>If the spread does widen, it will meet resistance at 98-100 basis points, where a trendline and psychological resistance coincide, analysts said.</p>
<p>Beyond there, Miller found further resistance at 115 basis points.</p>
<p>But the trend is towards a spread tightening, with 50 basis points in view in the medium term, Miller added.</p>
<p>&quot;That tallies with what the economists are saying,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Ken Wattret, international economist at Paribas Capital Markets in London, also said he forecast a 50 basis point BTP/Bund spread by the end of the year, based on the assumption Italy will join European economic and monetary union (EMU) promptly.</p>
<p>But an immediate 15-basis point tightening in the spread was less likely, Wattret added.</p>
<p>&quot;I am struggling to come up with fundamental reasons why the spread should narrow significantly in the short term.</p>
<p>&quot;The market needs momentum -- that momentum might come in the form of technical factors.&quot;</p>
