<p>Germany said on Wednesday it wanted to discuss a way to solve a fight between General Motors Corp and Volkswagen AG with the United States amid a new report saying GM would seek billions of dollars from its German rival.</p>
<p>German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said in Bonn that he would discuss a way to end the bitter legal battle between the two major carmakers with U.S. officials at the World Trade Organisation meeting next week in Singapore.</p>
<p>&quot;I will take the topic along to Singapore,&quot; Rexrodt told reporters at a briefing about the upcoming WTO meeting from December 7-13 in the Asian city-state.</p>
<p>Germany's Stern magazine also reported on Wednesday that GM and its German arm, Adam Opel AG, will demand at least six billion marks ($3.8 billion) in damages from VW in its U.S. lawsuit over allegations of industrial espionage.</p>
<p>Stern magazine said the provisional figure was reached by GM and Opel estimating that more than 4,000 pages of secret information with prices for about 110,000 car components were taken by top GM executives who quit in 1993 to join VW.</p>
<p>VW has vehemently denied the allegations.</p>
<p>If a U.S. jury were to rule in favour of GM and Opel, a U.S. racketeering law being applied to the case would automatically triple any damages, making VW liable to pay under the minimum request almost 20 billion marks.</p>
<p>Previous published reports in Germany and the U.S. have put the damages that GM would seek at anywhere from a couple of hundred million dollars to up to $7.5 billion.</p>
<p>An Opel spokesman declined comment on the Stern report and Opel chief executive David Herman said on Tuesday the carmaker had not yet specificed what it would seek from VW.</p>
<p>&quot;What the right amount will be is something that will come out of a full analysis of the facts, including the results of the discovery phase of the lawsuit,&quot; Herman said.</p>
<p>Stern said the data at the centre of the case helped VW, Europe's largest carmaker, cut annual costs by about four billion marks, saving the firm about 10 percent of the 40 billion marks it spends each year on parts.</p>
<p>GM alleges that its former top purchasing executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, used the information to cut some 700 million marks of costs at Volkswagen and quickly erode the 20 percent cost advantage Opel had over its German rival.</p>
<p>Lopez resigned last Friday from the VW management board, with his lawyers saying he did so to prepare his defence for GM's U.S. lawsuit and for expected German criminal charges.</p>
<p>A German prosecutor on Wednesday said a decision on whether to file criminal charges against Lopez and at least four of his associates who followed him to VW from GM would be made some time in mid-December.</p>
<p>Herbert Spohn, a spokesman for the Darmstadt public prosecutors' office near Frankfurt, said prosecutors would hold a news conference sometime in mid-December to announce their decision on whether to file any criminal charges.</p>
<p>Lopez's German lawyer had said he expects the criminal charges to be filed against his client by the end of November.</p>
<p>Lopez and other top VW executives, including VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech, have been named as defendants in the U.S. lawsuit that alleges VW officials conspired to get the information as Lopez and seven other executives left GM.</p>
<p>Herman reaffirmed that Opel would consider an out-of-court deal but added that prior talks, which he said had not been held for some time, had failed.</p>
<p>Stern said the last round of talks were held in London in September between VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen and GM executive committee chairman John Smale with no success.</p>
<p>The magazine also said GM's investigation of the data allegedly taken by Lopez and his associates focuses on a new VW plant in Brazil where vans are built.</p>
<p>Stern said German public prosecutors had found the original plans in VW computers for the plant that were developed by Lopez while still at GM. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525</p>
