83167>>0>> Companies may soon be able to trade derivatives of major economic indicators, such as inflation and Gross Domestic Product (GDP), as a hedge against business risks, a seminar was told on Monday. Adrian Maconick, head of risk management at London-based Deloitte and Touche Consulting Group, said he saw demand from companies for derivatives products based on economic variables. "All sorts of things can be commoditised and, once they're a commodity, you can have a futures and an options exchange to manage the risk," he told a seminar on Financial Markets in 2000 at a two-day derivatives forum in Amsterdam. Maconick said the technology used in exchange-traded options and futures businesses could be applied in a wider arena. He could not predict when he believed derivative products based on economic indicators would be introduced but believed it was technically feasible to do it. After the seminar, Maconick told Reuters he expected strong demand from companies for products that addressed business risk, which he saw as bigger for companies than financial risk. He said companies could deal with many of these challenges internally, but they would also need specific derivatives to deal with specific risks. "The most obvious ones are the big economic variables -- things like GDP and inflation. There's no technical reason why these cannot become derivatives," he said. "At the moment, there isn't a clear market to handle it." Business risks include changes in demand for a company's products while financial risks include movements in interest rates and currencies. Maconick said firms could currently get tailor-made "one-off" products or use surrogates for these indicators, such as metal prices, which tended to move in line with economic activity, but these left a mismatch between risk and hedging. -- Garry West, Amsterdam newsroom 31-20-504 5000
83167>>0>> A German court said Wednesday it would rule at the end of the month on a charge of defamation brought by automaker Volkswagen AG against General Motors and GM's German subsidiary Adam Opel AG. Following statements from lawyers for both companies at a hearing at the Frankfurt District Court, Judge Guenther Kinnel closed proceedings and said he would announce the court's ruling on Oct. 30. VW is demanding 10 million German marks ($6.54 million) in damages for statements made by GM and Opel officials last March when GM filed a claim in the United States accusing VW of industrial espionage. Wednesday's hearing was the latest development in a three-year series of legal battle between the two car giants. GM alleges VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and seven other former GM managers stole secrets on purchasing and car production plans when they moved to VW in early 1993. Frustrated by the lack of progress in almost three years of legal action against VW in Germany, GM said at news conferences held on March 8 in Detroit and Ruesselsheim near Frankfurt it would seek justice in the United States in the espionage case by filing a complaint at a federal district court in Michigan. VW has since filed a motion to have that case dismissed. At Wednesday's hearing, VW's lawyers said GM had sought to prejudice public opinion at the news conferences when it said its U.S. complaint accused VW and top officials, including VW head Ferdinand Piech, of "conspiracy, conversion, the misappropriation of trade secrets and racketeering." The lawyers also accused Opel of seeking to present VW as a criminal organisation in the public eye, for example by distributing a chronology of the three-year saga to the press.

"You are welcome to try to prove that in the U.S., and we will know more when that lawsuit is over, but you were not justified to prejudice the case here on March 8," VW lawyer Juergen Kicker told Opel's representatives. Opel's lawyer Peter Heckel countered: "The behaviour of your client reminds me of a wrongdoer who cries 'Stop Thief' to conceal his own guilt." GM and Opel had a right to inform the public of the contents of its legal complaint and had tried hard to find adequate German translations for U.S. legal terms like "racketeering", Heckel said. VW and Opel dispatched their legal experts to the hearings but there were no senior executives present. ($1=1.5297 Mark)
83167>>0>> A German court said on Wednesday said it would rule by the end of the month on a charge of defamation brought by Volkswagen AG against rival carmaker Adam Opel AG. Volkwagen is seeking 10 million marks in damages for statements made by officials from Opel and its U.S. parent General Motors at news conferences last March to announce they had filed a lawsuit against VW on industrial espionage charges. Following statements from lawyers for both companies at a hearing today, Judge Guenther Kinnel at the Frankfurt District Court closed the hearing and set October 30 as the date on which the court ruling would be announced. Volkwagen and GM have been bitterly squaring off in a series of legal battles since Jose Ignacio Lopez di Arriortua left GM to join VW as head of production and procurement in 1993. GM alleges that Lopez and several other former GM executives who joined VW with him stole industrial secrets. At news conferences in March, GM and Opel officials announced they were launching a lawsuit in the U.S. against VW. --David Crossland, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> President Bill Clinton on Friday signed into law a spending authorisation for a dozen U.S. intelligence agencies despite misgivings about some of its provisions, which he said he would seek to rectify. Clinton also signed a related measure, the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, which strengthens safeguards against the theft or misuse of proprietary business information. "Until today, federal law has not accorded appropriate or adequate protection to trade secrets, making it difficult to prosecute thefts involving this kind of information," Clinton said in a written statement. He said the new statute was "an outstanding example" of his administration, Congress and business working together to provide law enforcement with the tools to combat the problems of economic espionage and trade secret theft. The funding level of the intelligence authorisation was secret, but Clinton said in a statement it "largely reflects my budget request." The United States reportedly spends about $28 billion a year on foreign intelligence operations. Clinton expressed reservations about some provisions of the bill that he said either duplicate initiatives he has taken or encroach on his constitutional powers. These included a stipulation that two new National Security Council committees be created, a requirement that the director of central intelligence (DCI) be consulted on certain appointments, and the mandating of three new intelligence posts. "The administration has supported the concept of obtaining the DCI's concurrence or consultation prior to the appointment of certain other intelligence officials," Clinton said. But he said he would mandate this by executive order to avoid possible constitutional problems with making it law. Clinton said the three new intelligence posts would just be another layer of bureaucracy, and vowed to ask the next Congress to repeal this provision.
83167>>0>> Croatia announced on Monday it had hired foreign auditor Arthur Andersen to review finances of state-owned firms as part of a restructuring programme to be co-financed by the World Bank, news agency HINA reported. Head of the office for economics and restructuring of public sector firms, Dunja Vidosevic was quoted as saying the bank had granted Croatia $5 million for technical assistance on the project of extensive economic and financial sector reforms. They are to include a rehabilitation and privatisation of state firms, including national oil utility INA and railways, and a radical banking overhaul. As a first step, the government will have all public sector firms independently audited in accordance with international standards and introduce a single financial reporting system by the end of February 1997. After the debts of these firms are identified, it should also enforce stricter internal auditing and supervision as vital for cost cutting and improving their efficiency. Large enterprises are later to be trimmed down in size through a sale of non-core businesses and substantial layoffs. Of 16 public sector firms, three made losses last year led by INA with a 1.2 billion kuna loss. -- Kolumbina Bencevic, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075
83167>>0>> General Motors Corp, responding to reports that Volkswagen AG hired former political consultant Dick Morris to help in a public relations battle with GM, said it will rely on a jury to decide the matter. "We remain committed to presenting our case to a jury, not focusing on how best to put a particular spin on events for the media," GM said in a statement read by GM spokesman John Mueller. The International Herald-Tribune said Morris, who resigned from President Clinton's campaign following newspaper reports that he had an affair with a prostitute, had been retained to help VW in its public relations battle with the world's largest automaker. GM sued VW last March, alleging VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and several other top VW executives stole product and purchasing secrets when they left GM to work at VW in 1993. VW has denied the claims, and filed a countersuit against GM. A federal district court judge in Detroit is scheduled to hear motions from VW to remove the suit on Wednesday.
83167>>0>> German carmaker Volkswagen AG denied on Tuesday a newspaper report saying it had hired as a consultant former White House consultant Dick Morris, who resigned after a tabloid reported his affair with a prostitute. The International Herald-Tribune quoted VW chief spokesman Klaus Kocks as saying Morris had been hired to help in its public relations battle with General Motors Corp. A VW spokesman denied the report, saying VW had not signed a contract with Morris. Kocks was not available for comment. The report said Morris was hired ahead of a critical U.S. federal court hearing on Wednesday in Detroit, the latest step in the battle between GM and its German subsidiary Opel and Volkswagen over allegations of industrial espionage. GM has charged that former executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who left GM for VW in March 1993 with seven other GM executives, took with them documents on purchasing and production plans. Volkswagen has denied the charges. On Wednesday, a judge in Detroit will hear Volkswagen's arguments to have GM's case alleging industrial espionage thrown out of court. If the judge allows GM to proceed with the case, VW's top executives, including VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech, could be put on trial. VW has countered by filing a separate complaint in a German court alleging that GM's public accusations amount to a breach of German competition laws.
83167>>0>> German carmaker Volkswagen AG has hired as a consultant, former White House consultant Dick Morris, who resigned after a tabloid reported his affair with a prostitute, a newspaper reported on Tuesday. The International Herald-Tribune quoted VW chief spokesman Klaus Kocks as saying Morris had been hired to help in its public relations battle with General Motors Corp. VW, Europe's largest carmaker, hired Morris less than two months after he withdrew from the Clinton campaign. Kocks was unavailable for comment on Tuesday. Another VW spokesman declined comment on the report. The hiring of Morris comes ahead of a critical U.S. federal court hearing on Wednesday in Detroit in the battle between GM and its German subsidiary Opel and Volkswagen over allegations of industrial espionage.

83167>>0>> Lawyers for General Motors Corp. and Volkswagen AG were to face off in a U.S. court for the first time Wednesday in the three-year-old saga of J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and GM's industrial espionage charges against VW. In a hearing scheduled for 2 p.m. EDT, 1800 GMT, U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds will hear oral arguments on several motions in the lawsuit GM filed against Volkswagen in March, including VW's motion to dismiss the case. GM alleges that when Lopez abruptly left the Detroit-based automaker to become VW's production chief in March 1993, he stole trade secrets, including product plans, worldwide prices that GM pays for parts, and plans for a super-efficient manufacturing concept called "Plant X." The lawsuit alleges that Lopez, VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech and other defendants set up an elaborate operation to copy GM information into VW computers and then shredded the documents. GM claims that the Plant X concept, in which outside suppliers take a greater role in vehicle assembly, was used in a new VW plant in Brazil. Volkswagen has denied the allegations. If Edmunds rules that the case can proceed, another hearing will be held Oct. 28 to determine whether GM's claims of racketeering, copyright infringement and trademark violations should be included in a trial on the case. GM had difficulty serving the suit to Lopez, who has avoided the United States since he left GM. But GM process servers caught up with him at a VW executive meeting in Vancouver, Canada, in June and served him with the suit as he used a telephone in a hotel lobby. GM also will ask Edmunds whether it can mail the suit to three of the 11 defendants in the suit who have not yet been served -- VW executives Jorge Alvarez, Rosario Piazza and Andre Versteeg. VW, subject to continuing criminal investigations in both Germany and the United States, sued GM and its Adam Opel AG unit for defamation in a German court in May, claiming GM made false accusations against VW. A decision in that case is expected Oct. 30.
83167>>0>> A delegation of the London club creditors is due to begin "technical" talks on Yugoslavia's commercial debt in Belgrade on October 17, the daily Nasa Borba reported on Wednesday. "It is not a senior delegation since the forthcoming talks are purely of a technical nature," John Eisenhammer of Lowe Bell Financial, Yugoslavia's public relations adviser, was quoted by Nasa Borba as saying. Eisenhammer said the two delegations would discuss documents submitted by the Yugoslav government to the London Club, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank on the economic situation and economic forecasts. No-one from the Yugoslav delegation was immediately available for comment. Creditors last met Yugoslav officials in London in July to discuss rescheduling the $2 billion commercial debt inherited by rump Yugoslavia after the violent breakup of the former federation in 1991. Eisenhammer said "real" talks with the London club on how to reschedule Yugoslavia's commercial debt could be expected in December, as well as preliminary talks with the World bank, while talks with the IMF were still uncertain. "World Bank experts can be expected in Belgrade at the end of the year. As for the IMF, there is no timing," he said. -- Amra Kevic, Belgrade newsroom +381 11 2224305
83167>>0>> A Taiwan businessman turned himself in to local authorities, claiming he had collected state secrets for the island's rival, China, over the past two years, state media said on Wednesday. The businessman, surnamed Chang, told the Bureau of Investigation that he had helped spies from mainland China to collect the island's national defence and foreign policy secrets. In return, Beijing helped Chang with his investment projects on the mainland, the reports said. "This is the first case this year," a bureau official said on state television. "Related authorities are closely monitoring similar cases." The bureau declined to give further details. The businessman was under investigation for espionage, state media said. China has viewed Taiwan as a renegade province since a civil war separated them in 1949. Taiwan has banned all direct official contact with communist China. All investment projects must be routed through a third territory, usually Hong Kong. Despite the ban, indirect commerce has flourished since the late 1980s when political tensions started to thaw. Some 30,000 Taiwan firms have poured more than US$20 billion into China.
83167>>0>> A federal judge dealt a major blow to Volkswagen AG Wednesday and allowed a General Motors Corp lawsuit -- which alleges the German automaker stole corporate secrets -- to proceed in the heart of the American automotive capitol. U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds denied a motion from VW to dismiss the lawsuit after hearing arguments from Richard Denvir, an attorney representing VW. Denvir said the suit should be dismissed because it duplicates cases in Germany, is mostly a European matter and would be inconvenient for the majority of witnesses, who live in Germany and other parts of Europe. He estimated the cost of interpreters and translating 10,000 pages of documents could be more than $5 million. "This case does uniquely belong here in Detroit," Edmunds said. "I believe there will be inconviences to some witnesses, regardless of where the case is tried. I don't see the balance of hardship leaning strongly one way or the other." GM filed its lawsuit in U.S. District Court here last March. It alleges that VW's top production chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and several other executives stole trade secrets, including product plans, parts purchasing information and plans for a super-efficient manufacturing concept when they defected to VW in March 1993. Lopez had been GM's top purchasing executive when he abruptly left to join the German automaker, setting in motion the now three-year saga. Edmunds' ruling could mean that top VW executives, including Chairman Ferdinand Piech, could be forced to testify in GM's hometown. It could also expose VW to the more lenient rules of discovery and fact-finding allowed by U.S. courts. Attorney Eugene Driker, who represented GM, told Edmunds Volkswagen sought to have the case dismissed because the German automaker wants to avoid having its executives testify under oath in a U.S. court. He dismissed arguments about inconveniencing VW executives. "There can't be a more important concern to this court than the ability of the automotible industry to protect itself from the theft of its trade secrets," he said. The lawsuit alleges that Lopez, Piech and other defendants set up an elaborate operation to copy GM information into VW computers and then shredded the documents. GM says the Plant X concept, in which outside suppliers take a greater role in vehicle assembly, was used in a new VW plant in Brazil. Volkswagen has denied the allegations. Attorney Denvir said the company will continue to vigorously defend itself. "It's very unusual to get rid of a case at this stage," he said after the ruling. "We would have been very surprised and delighted if we had won." In another ruling Wednesday, Edmunds said several VW executives who left GM with Lopez could be included in GM's lawsuit in Detroit. They are: Jorge Alvarez Aguirre, Rosario Piazza, Francisco Garcia-Sanz, Hugo Van Der Auwera, Willibrordus Admiraal, Andries Versteeg, Jairo Wicker, and H. W. Lytle. Edmunds said she has not yet decided if Piech and Jens Neumann, a member of VW's board of management, should be included as defendants. Also undecided is whether VW's Volkswagen of America unit can be named as a defendant, and if a similar GM lawsuit in Spain should be joined with the U.S. lawsuit. The judge said she will make that decision in a written opinion to be filed before Oct. 28. Edmunds ruling Wednesday clears the way for another hearing Oct. 28 to determine whether GM's claims of racketeering, copyright infringement and trademark violations should be included in a trial of the case. GM had difficulty serving the lawsuit to Lopez, who has avoided the United States since he left GM.

83167>>0>> German shares closed largely flat on Thursday, subdued throughout the day by uncertainty surrounding the political situation in Russia. The DAX index of 30 leading shares closed floor dealings almost unchanged at 2,716.26 points before news came through that Russian security chief Alexander Lebed had been sacked. That initially pushed the IBIS DAX index of all-day computer trade off highs reached earlier in the day, but the index later recovered much of the ground lost to end 12.44 points, or 0.46 percent, higher at 2,717.50 points. The most obvious beneficiary of the news was the dollar, whose gains in turn encouraged export-orientated German stocks, which react positively to mark weakness. Despite Russian political instability, dealers said the psychological and technical level of 2,700 points for the DAX was unlikely to be breached this week. "The 2,700 level looks safe in any case," one dealer said. A gain of almost half a percent during early Wall Street was also supportive. Dealers said software concern SAP AG had attracted interest during the day. SAP, which was rated top performing German company by a magazine on Wednesday, climbed 1.4 percent or 3.80 marks to end IBIS trade at 279 marks. Car-maker Volkswagen stock ended IBIS trade down 2.75 marks at 584 after a U.S. judge on Wednesday denied a motion by VW seeking to block a lawsuit filed against it by U.S. automotive giant General Motors Co. The GM lawsuit accuses VW and several of its top executives of stealing corporate secrets. "It has had more of an impact on sentiment than anything else. There has been some negativity surrounding VW shares anyway," one German automotive sector analyst said. But he added that if the price fell any further, many investors would see it as an opportunity to buy back VW shares. Daimler-Benz AG gained 1.82 marks to end computer trade at 88.95 after sources confirmed it was considering a plan for an internal "merger" of its Mercedes car- and truck-making unit within the Daimler parent company itself. The move was seen as a part of attempt by Daimler chief Juergen Schrempp to make the group's individual operating units more responsive and focussed on quality.
83167>>0>> General Motors Corp is hopeful that a case pending in a U.S. court will find it entitled to compensation in connection with a complaint concerning a former GM executive who left over three years ago to work for Volkswagen AG. The ruling is the latest twist in a protracted legal battle involving Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who left GM to work for VW in March 1993. "We believe the forthcoming case concerning this civil complaint will not only lead to remedies of the substantial damages suffered by Opel and General Motors, but also finally to a judicial determination of the wrongful acts in conjuction with Lopez's move to VW, which the defendents have now been attempting to prevent for three and one-half years," GM said. The statement, released from GM's European headquarters, followed news Wednesday that a U.S. district judge denied a motion by VW to dismiss a lawsuit filed by GM against VW and some of its executives, including Lopez. GM has accused them of stealing trade secrets. VW has denied the allegations. -- Zurich Editorial, +41 1 631 7340

83167>>0>> A leading Turkish businessman said on Friday Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's Islamist-led government was working on a medium-term economic programme. "The economy's problems are obvious. But we see that a technical study is being carried. We have learnt that the government is working on a three-year programme," Anatolian news agency quoted Halis Komili, head of the influential busineesmen and industrialists association TUSIAD, as saying. Komili said he did not have details of the programme which he said would focus on privatisation. No official confirmation of studies for such a package was mmediately available. TUSIAD has long been urging the government to implement a medium-term stability programme to lower high inflation of around 80 percent and to narrow huge deficits.

83167>>0>> A boardroom battle at Daimler-Benz AG, Germany's largest industrial group, may be nearing a showdown because only one member opposes a planned management restructuring, sources close to the company said. Six out of seven board members at Daimler favour plans to integrate the Mercedes-Benz AG luxury car unit into the parent company, sources close to the company told Reuters. Also Hilmar Kopper, head of Daimler's supervisory board and management board chairman at Germany's largest commercial bank Deutsche Bank, has signalled his approval of the plan, German newsmagazine Der Spiegel reported at the weekend. Meanwhile, only Helmut Werner, chief executive of the Mercedes unit and a Daimler board member, opposes the move, the sources told Reuters. The situation may come to a head as early as this week when the executive committee of Daimler's supervisory board meets on Tuesday. The full supervisory board will meet on November 6. Three other Mercedes board members, Kurt Lauk, Juergen Hubbert and Dieter Zetsche, have signed off on the plan, German newspapers reported at the weekend. Werner, who was seen as a contender for the top job at Daimler before Juergen Schrempp was appointed to succeed retiring chief Edzard Reuter last year, may face the end of his career at the carmaker if the plan is approved. Although Werner would remain on the Daimler board if Mercedes were intergrated, he would effectively be made redundant and has threatened to resign if the internal merger were agreed, the Stuttgarter Zeitung reported last week. Spiegel reported that Kopper hopes to avoid having Werner leave the company. The plan to fuse Mercedes with its parent company is seen as part of a drive by Daimler-Benz chief Juergen Schrempp to take Daimler back to its roots as a transport group, reversing the trend begun by Edzard Reuter to create an integrated technology holding group. Mercedes said there was no official comment on Sunday, saying only that none of the Mercedes board members had been asked about the row and had not commented on it either. Daimler also had no comment. Analysts have said the plan would be a logical next step following the dissolution earlier this year of Daimler's loss-making AEG industrial division and the divestment of the majority-held Fokker Dutch plane-maker unit. Mercedes, which now makes up around three-quarters of Daimler's group revenues, predicted that its 1996 profits will be "clearly" higher than last year's 2.275 billion mark profit, the Boersen Zeitung reported in its Saturday edition. The paper also quoted Mercedes official Juergen Fahr as predicting 1996 sales could reach 75 billion marks, topping 1995's 72 billion mark turnover. Fahr was optimistic that the group would be able to recoup production lost when plants were boycotted by workers demonstrating against Daimler's decision to adopt German law and award workers only 80 percent pay during illness. Schrempp, a champion of the move for "shareholder value" in Germany, is under great pressure to fulfil a promise to return Daimler to profitability in 1996 after the 5.7 billion marks loss made by the group in 1995. As the row progresses, some sources believed Schrempp would seek to avoid any potentially damaging power struggle with Werner and could be ready to offer him the position of deputy chairman in the reshuffled Daimler board. Any integration of Mercedes-Benz was seen as likely to be accompanied by the appointment of at least three current Mercedes managers to the main board. But Werner's bargaining position within the company is seen as weaker than Schrempp's in that, unlike Daimler veteran Schrempp, he is a relative newcomer to the group. -- Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG Chairman Ferdinand Piech and another top executive must continue to defend themselves in General Motors Corp.'s industrial espionage lawsuit against the German automaker, a federal judge ruled Monday. U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds in Detroit has not yet issued a written opinion, but told lawyers in the case that she has decided to deny VW's motion to exclude Piech and VW management board member Jens Neumann from the suit, a court clerk said Tuesday. Edmunds also ruled that Volkswagen AG, in addition to its Volkswagen of America Inc. subsidiary, must continue to defend itself against GM's charges. GM alleges that Volkswagen's production chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, conspired with Piech, Neumann and others to steal GM corporate secrets when he left GM to join VW in March 1993. GM claims Lopez and seven executives who followed him to VW took vital parts pricing data, future product plans and proprietary manufacturing techniques, among other information. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. Edmunds last week denied VW's motion to dismiss the case, a decision that allows GM to pursue justice on its home turf in the heart of the U.S. auto industry instead of having to rely on German courts. Criminal investigations on the matter are still underway in both Germany and the United States, and a civil suit is still active in Braunschweig, Germany. In a hearing last week, lawyers for GM argued that Piech and Neumann should remain defendants in the lawsuit based on claims that they conspired with Lopez to steal the documents when they hired him away from GM. Lawyers for VW argued that the two executives should be dismissed from the case because they rarely visted the United States and that GM lacked proof of direct involvement in the alleged theft of documents. But Edmunds last week said that GM's complaint contained a lot of detail and merited further consideration in regard to Piech's and Neumann's roles. "This is not a bare-bones complaint. It names names, it cites dates of lunch meetings and phone conversations," she said. A GM spokesman said the Detroit-based automaker was pleased that Edmunds extended the court's jurisdiction over Piech, Neuman and the VW parent company. "Today's ruling reinforces our confidence that the substantial damages we suffered in connection with Lopez' departure for VW will be remedied," he said. A spokesman at Volkswagen of America's headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich., was not immediately available for comment. On Oct. 28, Edmunds will hear oral arguments on VW's motions to dismiss other GM claims in the case, including those accusing VW of copyright and trademark infringement, that VW engaged in unfair trade practices and that it conspired in violation of the federal Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organisations (RICO) Act. The RICO act gives prosecutors and civil litigators broad powers to pursue activity that shows a pattern of racketeering and conspiracy. It has been widely used to prosecute organised crime in the United States.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG Chairman Ferdinand Piech and management board member Jens Neumann must remain as defendants in General Motors Corp.'s industrial espionage lawsuit against the German automaker, a federal judge decided on Monday. U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds has not yet issued a written opinion, but told lawyers in the case on Monday that she will deny VW's motion to exclude Piech and Neumann from the suit, a court clerk said Tuesday.   Edmunds also ruled that Volkswagen AG, in addition to its Volkswagen of America Inc subsidiary, must continue to defend itself against GM's charges. GM alleges that Volkswagen's production chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, conspired with Piech, Neumann and others to steal GM corporate secrets when he left GM to join VW in March 1993. GM claims Lopez and several executives who followed him to VW took vital parts pricing data, future product plans and proprietary manufacturing techniques, along with other information. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.   Edmunds last week denied VW's motion to dismiss the case, a decision that allows GM its day in court in the heartland of the U.S. auto industry instead of in Germany. In a hearing last week, lawyers for GM argued that Piech and Neumann should remain as defendants in the lawsuit based on claims that they conspired with Lopez to steal the secrets when they hired him away from GM.   Lawyers for VW argued that the two executives should be dismissed from the case because of their infrequent visits to the United States and GM's lack of proof of their direct involvement in the events dealt with in the case. But Edmunds last week said that GM's complaint contained a lot of detail and merited further consideration in regard to Piech's and Neumann's roles. "This is not a bare-bones complaint. It names names, it cites dates of lunch meetings and phone conversations," she said. A GM spokesman said in a statement that the Detroit-based automaker was pleased that Edmunds extended the court's jurisdiction over Piech, Neuman and the VW parent company.

The directive, amending amend 70/156/EEC, will include all 13 amendments demanded by the European Parliament under the co-decision procedure and will be adopted by the Council in Luxembourg without further discussion as an A point. The directive will introduce for all vehicle types approved after October 1, 1998, technical prescriptions for frontal impact resistance developed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe on the basis of experimental research work carried out by the European Experimental Vehicle Committee. The directive aims to reduce the number of people seriously killed or seriously injured in road accidents.

83167>>0>> Shares in Volkswagen AG rose nearly three percent on Monday after Bonn proposed repealing laws governing the carmaker which analysts said will give the group more freedom and small shareholders additional clout. German Justice Ministry parliamentary state secretary Rainer Funke told a Frankfurt conference that two sections of the so-called "VW Laws" have been proposed to be repealed that affect proxy voting rights and the maximum number of shares that can be used for voting at VW's annual general meeting. But he said laws that require VW to maintain its production sites in Germany would not be affected. Current law prevents anyone from exercising more than 20 percent of the voting rights in VW shares and from giving proxy rights to another person to vote on company matters, a common procedure in Germany. A Volkswagen spokesman said the company viewed the changes as "neutral", while a spokesman for the Lower Saxony government in Hanover said the state would not fight the rule changes. VW shares ended bourse trade up 14.75 marks at 597.75 marks and advanced to a new year's record high at 608 marks in IBIS electronic dealings before trading at about 600 marks. The state of Lower Saxony, where VW is based, has been the carmaker's largest shareholder with its 20 percent of VW's voting rights held since the carmaker was privatised in 1961 and its shares listed on German stock exchanges. Funke said existing laws kepted the number of shareholders attending VW annual general meetings at about 40 percent of the voting rights and gave Lower Saxony considerable influence over dealings at VW, considered Europe's largest carmaker. Funke, who heads a government group developing new stock market laws expected to be implemented in 1998, said in a newspaper interview on Monday that Lower Saxony would still play an important role in the dealings of Volkswagen. "Anyone who has a 20 percent stake is still going to be strong," he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. The proposals, which Funke expected to be implemented in 1998, are not expected to have an impact on day-to-day operations at VW but help in its strategic planning, particularly at a time when it considers more foreign ventures and how to deal with its massive German workforce. "The current laws were a millstone around VW management's neck," said one industry analyst. "They blocked efforts at restructuring, made sure jobs were kept. It's a very important step in their restructuring but I do not see major change." The laws to be repealed date back to when Volkswagen, founded by Ferdinand Porsche in the 1920s and who later received backing from Adolf Hitler in 1937, was a state-owned group after World War Two and its stock was sold to the public. Industry analysts also said they did not see any political undertones to the proposal since Lower Saxony is led by Social Democrat minister president Gerhard Schroeder, who is expected to challenge Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the 1998 election.
83167>>0>> A U.S. federal judge heard arguments Monday over General Motors Corp.'s claims of racketeering, copyright and trademark infringement in its industrial espionage lawsuit against Volkswagen AG. U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds in Detroit said she would issue a ruling on whether GM would be allowed to pursue its claims against VW at a later date.   GM accuses VW's production chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and other executives of stealing trade secrets -- including product plans, supplier prices and manufacturing techniques -- when he abruptly left GM to join VW in March 1993. At the heart of GM's civil complaint are allegations that Lopez, VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech, management board member Jens Neumann and other top executives formed a conspiracy to steal the documents in violation of the U.S. Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).   The law, which has been widely used to prosecute organized crime figures in the United States, is aimed at thwarting conspiracies and criminal enterprises that show an ongoing pattern of illegal activity. A jury finding in favor of GM's RICO claims could make the automaker eligible for triple damages.   On Monday, lawyers for VW argued before Edmunds that GM's claims -- assuming they were true -- do not extend over a period long enough to establish a pattern under RICO. The conspiracy was alleged to have taken place between August and November 1992, when Piech and Neumann were recruiting Lopez, VW attorneys said. "What they have alleged is merely a single scheme with no future threat of repetition," said James Denvir, a Washington-based lawyer representing VW.   But attorneys for GM argued that VW was maintaining an ongoing scheme to damage the Detroit-based automaker by continuing to use the information that Lopez and his followers allegedly stole. William Sankbeil, another VW attorney, characterized GM's lawsuit as an act of retribution over the disappointment and embarrassment it suffered when Lopez was hired away. "This case is about colossal egos at the world's largest industrial corporation," Sankbeil told the judge, "egos that could not tolerate a competitor winning a key employee."   While Edmunds did not rule on the RICO, copyright and trademark infringement issues, she did on Monday deny a VW motion to exclude H. William Lytle, Volkswagen of America Inc's former director of human resources, as a defendant in the suit. GM alleges that Lytle received boxes of stolen documents from Lopez at the Auburn Hills, Mich., headquarters of Volkswagen of America and shipped them on to Germany. GM also alleges Lytle made interstate telephone calls as part of the alleged conspiracy. An attorney for Lytle argued that he committed no illegal acts and merely conducted routine business in the course of hiring a new employee.

83167>>0>> A sailor was sentenced to 27 years in prison on Monday for attempting to sell U.S. Navy secrets to Russia, a military spokesman said. Kurt Lessenthien, a machinist's mate first class, had pleaded guilty in September to attempted espionage and failure to properly safeguard classified material. A military panel sentenced 30-year-old Lessenthien to life in prison, but under a pre-trial agreement his term was limited to 27 years, a statement from the Navy said. Lessenthien allegedly sold classified material on the Navy's submarine programme in April, but the buyer was an undercover FBI agent. None of the secret material reached foreign hands, investigators said. The sentence handed down by a six-member panel of officers will automatically be appealed to military court in Washington, D.C. According to local news reports, Lessenthien telephoned the Russian Embassy in Washington from Orlando, Florida where he was an instructor at the Navy's Nuclear Power School. He then offered to trade material on the Navy submarine programme in exchange for cash. But the call was intercepted and a team of FBI and Naval Criminal Investigative Service agents teamed up on the case. At a subsequent meeting an FBI agent posing as a foreign agent paid Lessenthien an undisclosed sum for what he called top secret documents, the (Virginia) Daily Press said. The sailor was arrested in April after the exchange, which was videotaped, and taken to the Norfolk Naval Base. He joined the Navy in 1984 and served on three submarines.
83167>>0>> General Motors Corp.'s U.S. industrial espionage lawsuit against Volkswagen AG moved a step forward Monday as a federal judge heard arguments over GM's racketeering, copyright and trademark infringement claims. U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds in Detroit said she will issue a ruling at a later date on whether GM should be allowed to pursue such claims against VW. GM accuses VW's production chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and other executives of stealing trade secrets when he abruptly left GM to join VW in March 1993, including product plans, supplier prices and manufacturing techniques. At the heart of GM's civil complaint are allegations that Lopez, VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech, management board member Jens Neumann and other top executives formed a conspiracy to steal the documents that violated the U.S. Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO). The law, which has been widely used to prosecute organised crime in the United States, is aimed at thwarting conspiracies and criminal enterprises that show a pattern of illegal activity. A jury finding in favour of GM's RICO claims could make the automaker eligible for triple damages. On Monday, lawyers for VW argued before Edmunds that GM's claims -- assuming they were true -- do not extend over a long-enough period of time to establish a sufficient pattern under RICO. The conspiracy was alleged to have taken place between August and November 1992, when Piech and Neumann were recruiting Lopez, VW attorneys said. "What they have alleged is merely a single scheme with no future threat of repetition," said James Denvir, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer representing VW. Attorneys for GM argued that VW was maintaining a scheme to damage the Detroit-based automaker by continuing to use the information that Lopez and his followers allegedly stole. William Sankbeil, another VW attorney, characterised GM's lawsuit as an act of retribution over the disappointment and embarrassment it suffered when Lopez was hired away. "This case is about colossal egos at the world's largest industrial corporation," Sankbeil told the judge. "Egos that could not tolerate a competitor winning a key employee." While Edmunds did not rule on the RICO, copyright and trademark infringement issues, she did on Monday deny a VW motion to exclude H. William Lytle, Volkswagen of America Inc.'s former director of human resources, as a defendant in the suit. GM alleges that Lytle received boxes of stolen documents from Lopez at the Volkswagen unit's Auburn Hills, Mich., headquarters and shipped them on to Germany for him and made interstate telephone calls as part of the alleged conspiracy. An attorney for Lytle argued that he committed no illegal acts and merely conducted routine business in the course of hiring a new employee.

83167>>0>> German carmaker Volkswagen AG suffered another legal blow on Wednesday in its fight against rival Adam Opel AG when a judge dismissed its lawsuit charging the unit of U.S. carmaker General Motors Corp with defamation. VW immediately said it would appeal the decision to a higher German court in the latest twist in a protracted legal battle in the U.S. and Germany over allegations that some top GM officials left the carmaker for VW with secret documents. "We will appeal," VW spokesman Klaus Kocks told Reuters. VW, Europe's largest carmaker, had sought 10 million marks ($6.6 million) in damages over statements made by Opel and General Motors at news conferences last March to announce they had filed a lawsuit against VW over alleged industrial espionage. The two carmakers have been bitterly squaring off in a series of legal battles in the U.S. and Germany since Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua left GM to join Volkswagen as head of production and procurement in 1993. GM alleges in its U.S. lawsuit that Lopez and several other former top GM executives, who joined VW with him, stole industrial secrets. VW has vehemently denied the charges. VW said in Frankfurt court hearing this month that GM and Opel had sought to prejudice public opinion at company news conferences by portraying the Wolfsburg-based carmaker as a criminal organisation. The Opel and GM officials accused VW and its top officials, including VW chief Ferdinand Piech, of conspiracy, misappropriation of trade secrets and racketeering. Frankfurt Judge Guenther Kinnel said in the written ruling issued on Wednesday that GM and Opel's statements were covered under freedom of speech laws and that Opel officials had only expressed their opinions about their U.S. lawsuit against VW. Lawyers for Opel hailed the latest court victory, saying the Frankfurt lawsuit had been a nuisance and that the focus would not shift to the Detroit proceedings. "We had expected this decision," said Peter Heckel, an attorney representing Opel. "Freedom of speech is very important under German law." VW also suffered a setback earlier this month when a U.S. federal court allowed General Motors to proceed with its action against VW in Detroit, the capital of the U.S. car industry. The next hearing in the Detroit court case has been set for December 3 and an Opel official said he expected the exchange of evidence in the case to begin by year-end. A trial date could be set for as early as next summer, he said. The U.S. lawsuit alleges that Lopez, Piech and other defendants set up an elaborate operation to copy GM information into VW computers and then shredded the documents. After unsuccessful attempts in Germany to serve VW executives with the suit, officials found Lopez and Piech during a June meeting of top VW executives in Canada. Lopez was served in the lobby of a Vancouver hotel as he used a telephone and Piech as he left a cocktail party. U.S. court documents said process servers alleged that they were physically harassed by VW security guards, including one who said he was grabbed around the neck by one guard. ($1=1.5130 Mark)

A trial date could be set for as early as next summer, he said. The U.S. lawsuit alleges that Lopez, Piech and other defendants set up an elaborate operation to copy GM information into VW computers and then shredded the documents. GM says its Plant X concept, in which outside suppliers take a greater role in vehicle assembly, was used in a new VW plant in Brazil. VW has gone to great lengths to fight the lawsuit in the U.S., a country with more liberal laws on seeking evidence, and protecting its executives from being officially served with GM's lawsuit. After unsuccessful attempts in Germany to serve VW executives with the suit, officials found Lopez and Piech during a June meeting of top VW executives in Canada. Lopez was served in the lobby of a Vancouver hotel as he used a telephone and Piech as he left a cocktail party.

83167>>0>> German shares ended Wednesday's bourse trade slightly higher, but at the day's low point, after the dollar slipped and German bonds lost some sheen following the surprise raising of the UK interest rate. The DAX index of 30 blue-chip shares closed up 5.11 points, or 0.19 percent, at 2,678.73, slipping back about ten points after Britain raised its base interest rate by 25 basis points to six percent. German players took the move as a signal that German interest rates would not sink further in the future. German exporting stocks also suffered after the dollar lost ground against the mark, slipping under 1.51 marks. Earlier the DAX had touched 2,691.55, encouraged by a firm close on Wall Street overnight, but volumes had been thin, dealers said. One of the most heavily traded DAX stocks was German's largest commercial bank, Deutsche Bank, which rose 94 pfennigs to touch 71.30 marks, after it said management board member Rolf Breuer would suceed Hilmar Kopper as chief executive. The stock lost some of its gains to end bourse trade up 49 pfennigs, or 0.7 percent, at 70.85 marks. Meanwhile shares in carmaker Volkswagen ignored news that German courts had dismissed its law suit against Opel, a unit of U.S. firm General Motors. VW shares rose 10.75 marks, or 1.8 percent, to 600.75 marks in bourse dealings. VW had sought 10 million marks in the suit, which was the latest twist in the ongoing legal battle between the two carmakers over charges top GM officials left for VW in 1993 and brought along trade secrets. VW, Europe's largest carmaker, has denied the charges brought by GM in a U.S. lawsuit. Dealers called the stock's rise "illogical" and said it should have been hurt by the news of the dismissal of the law suit. "VW is probably the new play-thing of the stock market after it lost SAP," said one dealer. Business software firm SAP had been the darling of the bourse, but plummeted last week after a profits warning.
83167>>0>> General Motors Corp hailed a German court's decision to dismiss a lawsuit by Volkswagen AG accusing the U.S. carmaker's Adam Opel AG unit of defamation.

"This decision ensures that the media will continue to be able to fully inform the public concerning important developments in the Lopez case." VW had sought 10 million marks in damages over statements made by Opel and GM at news conferences last March to announce they had filed a lawsuit against VW over alleged industrial espionage.

They said the DAX index of 30 leading shares was unlikely to push above the crucial 2,700 point level and would probably trade in a fairly narrow range. "The DAX should trade in a range between 2,670 and 2,695 today," said one dealer. Traders said the last few days, when the DAX index had traded between 2,670 and just over 2,700 points, had shown that both upside and downside potential of the market were limited, at least in the short run. In early trade, the DAX index was up 16.65 points, or 0.62 percent, at 2,690.27 points. Overnight the U.S. Dow Jones index ended 34.29 points firmer at 6,007.02. The most heavily traded DAX stock was German's largest commercial bank, Deutsche Bank, which rose 77 pfennigs to 71.13 marks, after itw suit against Opel, a unit of U.S. firm General Motors. VW shares rose 10 marks, or 1.7 percent, to 600 marks. VW had charged in the lawsuit that GM and Opel had made prejudicial statements in the public that portrayed it as a criminal organisation. VW had sought 10 million marks in the suit, which was the latest twist in the ongoing legal battle between the two carmakers over charges top GM officials left for VW in 1993 and brought along trade secrets. VW, Europe's largest carmaker, has denied the charges brought by GM in a U.S. lawsuit.

83167>>0>> A new book on links between German carmaker Volkswagen AG and the Nazis, accusing ancestors of current VW head Ferdinand Piech of using slave labour in factories, is causing trouble even before it is published. Piech, grandson of VW founder Ferdinand Porsche, says the authors of "Volkswagen and Its Workers in the Third Reich" turned the original manuscript into an attack on his family after he took over Europe's largest carmaker in 1993. Hans Mommsen, a co-author and one of Germany's best-known historians, replied that Volkswagen withdrew support for the book after Piech became head of the company. The two men squared off in the latest issue of Der Spiegel magazine ahead of the book's formal presentation on Wednesday. Volkswagen itself refused to comment on the growing row over the book, which the publisher says is the first to fully explain the role of a major industrial group in the Nazis' plans for and execution of World War Two. The book says Ferdinand Porsche, who created the Porsche sports car after the war, was a Nazi party member who was "morally indifferent" to using concentration camp inmates and prisoners of war to boost his firm's productivity. It portrays Porsche and his son-in-law Anton Piech, VW's wartime chief executive and father of the present boss, as responsible for the treatment of thousands of slave labourers. Mommsen told Spiegel he was commissioned to write VW's tell-all story in 1987 by then VW chief executive Carl Hahn, whose father was also an early car industry leader in Germany. "When the new guy (Piech) arrived, it was all over," Mommsen, who spent some 10 years on the book, told Spiegel. Piech rejected the accusations, telling Spiegel that VW poured almost 3,000,000 marks ($2 million) into the project and agreed to buy one-third of the book's first run of 3,000 copies, create an archive and fund a chair at a German university. He said his ancestors were neither Nazis nor anti-semitic, adding that his grandfather built a church which still stands on VW grounds, to the disgust of Nazi leadership. Piech accused Mommsen of changing the manuscript to target his family. "I read the first 600 pages of the book two or three years ago and my father's name never appeared," he said. Piech said the book could cause trouble for Volkswagen, which has been hurt by a nasty legal battle with rival General Motors Corp amid allegations it lured away top managers who brought secret documents with them. The book's publisher, Econ Verlag, sought to play down the dispute between Piech and Mommsen, saying only about 150 of the book's 1,056 pages deal with Porsche and his son-in-law. "Mommsen does not pass much judgment in the book but wants to explain what happened at the time. He wants to tell what happens when professionals met a system of fascism and how they reacted," said Econ Verlag editorial director Lutz Dursthoff. The book recounts how VW was founded by Porsche after he left Daimler-Benz AG in frustration, attracted Hitler with his dreams for a mass-produced car at a reasonable price and then got the Nazi leader to back the project. Newsreels showed Hitler riding around in a prototype VW convertible, but production was delayed by war. Porsche recruited Auschwitz inmates to work at a plant, building some of the V1 rockets used during the war against London and other cities. The plant, run by Anton Piech, also made other armaments and a jeep used as a model for the famed Beetle. The plant employed about 16,000 workers, most of them slave labourers from conquered countries, prisoners of war or concentration camp inmates. Many died at the Wolfsburg plant.
83167>>0>> A new book on links between German automaker Volkswagen AG and the Nazis, accusing ancestors of current VW head Ferdinand Piech of using slave labour in factories, is causing trouble even before it is published. Piech, grandson of VW founder Ferdinand Porsche, says the authors of "Volkswagen and Its Workers in the Third Reich" turned the original manuscript into an attack on his family after he took over Europe's largest carmaker in 1993. Hans Mommsen, a co-author and one of Germany's best-known historians, replied that Volkswagen withdrew support for the book after Piech became head of the company. The two men squared off in the latest issue of Der Spiegel magazine ahead of the book's formal presentation on Wednesday. Volkswagen refused to comment on the growing fight over the book, which the publisher says is the first to fully explain the role of a major industrial group in the Nazis' plans for and execution of World War II. The book says Ferdinand Porsche, who created the Porsche sports car after the war, was a Nazi party member who was "morally indifferent" to using concentration camp inmates and prisoners of war to boost his firm's productivity. It portrays Porsche and his son-in-law Anton Piech, VW's wartime chief executive and father of the present boss, as responsible for the treatment of thousands of slave labourers. Mommsen told Spiegel he was commissioned to write VW's tell-all story in 1987 by then-VW Chief Executive Carl Hahn, whose father was also an early German car industry leader. "When the new guy (Piech) arrived, it was all over," Mommsen, who spent some 10 years on the book, told Spiegel. Piech rejected the accusation, telling Spiegel that VW poured almost 3 million marks ($2 million) into the project and agreed to buy one-third of the book's first run of 3,000 copies, create an archive and fund a chair at a German university. He said his ancestors were neither Nazis nor anti-semitic, adding that his grandfather built a church that still stands on VW grounds, to the disgust of Nazi leadership. Piech accused Mommsen of changing the manuscript to target his family. "I read the first 600 pages of the book two or three years ago and my father's name never appeared," he said.

83167>>0>> Germany's Volkswagen AG warned rival carmakers Wednesday not to use a new company history revealing its former Nazi links and Third Reich slave labourers as negative advertising against it. Speaking at the presentation of the book, spokesman Klaus Kocks said VW, which is embroiled in a bitter court fight with U.S. carmaker General Motors Corp., felt a moral responsibility to shed light on this dark chapter in its history. If rivals made a link between the company's past and present, though, it would amount to a cheap bid to boost sales at VW's expense, he added. "You don't sell cars with things like this," Kocks said. VW is fighting an uphill battle in German and American courts, where it faces charges of defamation against General Motors over the company's charge that top GM managers took secret documents with them when they joined VW in 1993. VW says GM tried to slander its name by portraying the Wolfsburg-based carmaker as a criminal organisation and accusing top officials, including VW chief Ferdinand Piech, of conspiracy, misappropriation of trade secrets and racketeering. The two carmakers have been bitterly squaring off ever since Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua left GM to join VW as head of production and procurement in 1993. "Whatever one thinks of Mr. Lopez, either positive or negative, that has nothing to do with slave labourers in the Third Reich," Kocks said at the presentation of the 1,055-page history "Volkswagen and its Workers in the Third Reich." Hans Mommsen, a leading German historian and co-author of the VW-funded study, thanked the company for funding his study with 3.3 million marks ($2.17 million) and fully respecting its pledge not to try to influence or censor his conclusions. He also thanked current VW head Ferdinand Piech, the grandson of VW founder Ferdinand Porsche, and said there had been "quite a misunderstanding" over a reported dispute between him and Piech over his portrayal of the firm's founding family. Der Spiegel magazine reported on Monday that Piech had accused Mommsen of turning his original manuscript into an attack on his grandfather and his father, VW's wartime chief executive, Anton Piech. Kocks said Piech was personally concerned about the portrayal, which called Porsche a "morally indifferent" Nazi and said he and his son-in-law Anton Piech were mainly responsible for the treatment of thousands of slave labourers at VW. But he insisted the current VW boss was still committed to VW's decision to come clean on its past, something it backed by funding the book, a university chair and a VW archive. The book recounts how Porsche, who had been technical director at Daimler-Benz AG, took up Adolf Hitler's call to produce a cheap popular car -- the Volkswagen Beetle -- and founded VW to manufacture it. The plant employed about 16,000 workers, most of them slave labourers from conquered countries, prisoners of war or concentration camp inmates. Many died at the Wolfsburg plant. Fascinated by his technical dream, Porsche had no scruples about keeping slave labourers in dismal living conditions and forcing them to build cars and armaments, including the V1 rockets fired at London and other cities during the war. The book's publisher, Econ Verlag, said the original print run was only 3,000 but it expected demand for many more copies because of a recent surge of interest in the Third Reich. "Hitler's Willing Executioners," a disputed Holocaust book by U.S. sociologist Daniel Goldhagen, now ranks high in German best-seller lists despite its portrayal of the Germans as ingrained and blood-thirsty anti-Semites. The daily Die Welt remarked that it would be ironical if the controversy surrounding Goldhagen's study helped sell the VW book. Mommsen has been one of Goldhagen's toughest critics.

83167>>0>> A lawyer representing Volkswagen AG executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua said Friday he expected German prosecutors to file industrial spying charges against the former General Motors Corp. executive by the end of the month. The lawyer, Juergen Taschke, said in a statement issued by his Frankfurt office that he "still expected in November" charges to be filed against Lopez. Taschke issued the statement after he told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper that he expected Lopez and three other VW workers to face charges for allegedly taking secret data with them when they left GM in 1993. The three other executives -- identified as Jose Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez and Rosario Piazza -- left GM subsidiary Opel when Lopez defected to Volkswagen and joined its management board. In a bitter three-year legal dispute, GM and Opel have alleged that Lopez and seven other former GM managers stole secrets on purchasing and production plans when they moved to Volkswagen. VW, which has consistently denied the allegations, declined to comment on the report but said Lopez would stay with the company even if he were to face criminal charges. Lopez, a Basque, has been renowned for his ability to streamline production and cut costs, setting about innovative work practices at VW, Europe's largest carmaker, that have helped it to return to profitability. Volkswagen also referred calls to its Frankfurt lawyer, who was not immediately available to comment. The Frankfurt state prosecutors' office declined to confirm the newspaper report but a spokeswoman said a decision on whether to charge Lopez would be made by the end of the year. "We are not commenting on whether a decision has already been taken to bring charges or to terminate proceedings," Hildegard Becker-Toussaint, the office's spokeswoman, said in response to a query. Before a decision was made public, the parties involved would have to be informed by the Darmstadt public prosecutors' office, which is leading the probe, she added. VW sources said the Wolfsburg-based company, the largest carmaker in Europe, was preparing itself for charges to be filed against Lopez and the other executives, who were top and middle-level managers who reported to him. GM and Opel have also filed a lawsuit in Detroit against VW and its top executives, including Lopez and VW Management Board Chairman Ferdinand Piech, due to frustration at the pace of the German criminal investigation. GM first filed a legal complaint against Lopez and another former GM manager a month after Lopez's defection, but the company later suspended that action.

The three other executives -- identified as Jose Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez and Rosario Piazza -- left Opel, the German unit of Detroit-based GM, when Lopez left for VW in March 1993 and joined the German carmaker's management board. The German charges will relate to allegations that Lopez, who ran GM's worldwide purchasing operations, and other officials took secrets related to the design of a new manufacturing concept known as "Plant X", Taschke told the newspaper. VW, which has consistently denied the allegations, declined comment on Friday on the report but said Lopez would stay with the company even if he were to face criminal charges. The spokeswoman for the Frankfurt prosecutors' office declined comment on Taschke's statements, saying a decision would be made by year-end on whether criminal charges would be brought against Lopez and the other executives.

"We are not commenting on whether a decision has already been taken to bring charges or to terminate proceedings," spokeswoman Hildegard said.

83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG suffered another setback in its legal fight against General Motors Corp after a lawyer said on Friday he expected the top VW executive at the centre of the brawl to face criminal charges in Germany. The lawyer, Juergen Taschke, who represents embattled VW purchasing executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, said he expected German prosecutors to file charges of industrial spying against his client by the end of this month. Taschke said in a statement he "still expected in November" that charges would be filed against Lopez, a former GM global executive who allegedly took along secret company documents when he abruptly quit in 1993 to join the VW board. Taschke's acknowledgement of the pending charges was the latest blow for VW, which has recently lost two major court battles against Detroit-based GM in lawsuits in the U.S. and Germany involving Lopez. A German judge on October 30 dismissed a lawsuit by VW that sought 10 million marks ($6.62 million) in damages from Opel and GM for allegedly defaming the carmaker at company news conferences. And a U.S. district court judge in Detroit on October 16 also rejected a move by VW lawyers to have GM's civil lawsuit, which was filed in frustration at the lack of progress in the German criminal investigation, dismissed. A spokeswoman for the Frankfurt prosecutors' office said on Friday a decision would be made by the end of the year on whether to file charges against Lopez, bringing to an end a criminal investigation that has lasted more than three years. Lopez, a Basque, has been renowned for his ability to streamline production and cut carmaking costs, established innovative working practices at the Wolfsburg-based carmaker that have helped VW return to profitabilty. VW, which has vehemently denied allegations against Lopez and other top officials made by GM and its German unit Opel, declined comment on Taschke's statements. Taschke issued the statement after he told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Friday he expected Lopez and three other VW workers to face industrial spying charges. The three other VW executives in the German criminal probe, identified as Jose Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez and Rosario Piazza, left Opel shortly after Lopez defected to VW and joined the German carmaker's management board, he said. The German charges will relate to allegations that Lopez and others took secret plans related to the design of a new super-efficient manufacturing plan called "Plant X" that GM had under development, Taschke told the newspaper. GM, in waging a nearly four-year legal battle in the U.S. and Germany against VW, has alleged that VW used the secret information and other confidential data to build a new production plant in Brazil. The latest legal defeat also comes at a difficult time for the carmaker with the publication this week of a company history revealing sordid details of its former Nazi links and the use of Third Reich slave labour. VW this week warned rivals not to use the book as negative advertising against it, saying it felt a moral responsibility to shed light on the dark chapter of its corporate history. VW sources said they had expected that the charges would be filed against Lopez but that there were no immediate plans for him to be pushed out of the carmaker. "Lopez is not going to be dumped," one VW official said. But a German car industry executive said a decision on Lopez's future could be made at an upcoming supervisory board meeting scheduled sometime in the next two weeks. ($1=1.5104 Mark)

83167>>0>> Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Friday. LONDON - UK shares struggled to a modestly higher finish Friday after another disappointing week as interest rate worries continued to pressure the London market. The FTSE index closed at 3910.8 points, up 10.4 on the day but down 37.7 points on the week. FRANKFURT - The German DAX index of 30 leading shares ended floor trade at a record high on Friday, driven by gains in bond prices and by the Dow Jones index which ended overnight above 6,200 points for first time. The DAX raced up to a day's high of 2,744.90 points and then slipped back slightly to end up 26.61 points, or 0.98 percent, at 2,739.83, a new record bourse close. It was up 56.58 from last Friday. In post-bourse trade the index was up 8.04 at 2,732.29. PARIS - French shares closed in negative ground after racking up major gains this week, tracking Wall Street's welcome to Bill Clinton's return to the White House.

HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks capped a record-breaking week with a modest gain on Friday, finishing higher as investors took heart from the market's firm tone despite some profit-taking earlier in the day. The Hang Seng index closed 15.90 points higher at 12,751.16, up 221.89 on the week. SYDNEY - Australian shares extended their gains in the afternoon to close higher on Friday as modest bargain hunting emerged after Thursday's weakness. The All Ordinaries index climbed 15.4 points to 2,362.1, up 22.7 from a week ago. JOHANNESBURG - South African stocks ended the week down for the fifth day runnning as early promising gains from better-than-expected reserves data evaporated in the glare of prevailing negative sentiment.

The gold index fared no better than the industrials and lost 11.9 points to 1,681.1. This was down 41.4 from a week ago. A tottering bullion price was to blame, dealers said.
83167>>0>> A lawyer representing Volkswagen AG executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua said Friday he expected German prosecutors to file industrial spying charges against the former General Mortors Corp. executive by the end of the month. The lawyer, Juergen Taschke, said in a statement issued by his Frankfurt office that he "still expected in November" charges to be filed against Lopez. Taschke issued the statement after he told the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper that he expected Lopez and three other VW workers to face charges for allegedly taking secret data with them when they left GM in 1993. The three other executives -- identified as Jose Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez and Rosario Piazza -- left GM subsidiary Opel when Lopez defected to Volkswagen and joined its management board. In a bitter three-year legal dispute, GM and Opel have alleged that Lopez and seven other former GM managers stole secrets on purchasing and production plans when they moved to Volkswagen. VW, which has consistently denied the allegations, declined to comment on the report but said Lopez would stay with the company even if he were to face criminal charges. Lopez, a Basque, has been renowned for his ability to streamline production and cut costs, setting about innovative work practices at VW, Europe's largest carmaker, that have helped it to return to profitability. Volkswagen also referred calls to its Frankfurt lawyer, who was not immediately available to comment. The Frankfurt state prosecutors' office declined to confirm the newspaper report but a spokeswoman said a decision on whether to charge Lopez would be made by the end of the year. "We are not commenting on whether a decision has already been taken to bring charges or to terminate proceedings," Hildegard Becker-Toussaint, the office's spokeswoman, said in response to a query. Before a decision was made public, the parties involved would have to be informed by the Darmstadt public prosecutors' office, which is leading the probe, she added. VW sources said the Wolfsburg-based company, the largest carmaker in Europe, was preparing itself for charges to be filed against Lopez and the other executives, who were top and middle-level managers who reported to him. GM and Opel have also filed a lawsuit in Detroit against VW and its top executives, including Lopez and VW Management Board Chairman Ferdinand Piech, due to frustration at the pace of the German criminal investigation. GM first filed a legal complaint against Lopez and another former GM manager a month after Lopez's defection, but the company later suspended that action.

83167>>0>> Israel denied on Tuesday that an Israeli arrested in Egypt had been spying for the Jewish state and demanded his release. "We expect to see his immediate release so that he can return to his family which is waiting for him. Our obligation...is to demand his immediate release," Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told reporters in Cairo. "He is innocent of any wrongdoing and we will not rest until we see him return to his family, his country and his homeland," said Levy, in Egypt for a Middle East economic conference. Egyptian government newspapers said on Tuesday security authorities had arrested an Israeli and an Egyptian a few days ago on charges of spying for Israel. The daily al-Ahram said several charges, including espionage, were brought against the two men and a prosecutor had ordered them remanded for 15 days. "Security authorities uncovered the involvement of an Egyptian and an Israeli of Arab origin in working for the Israeli intelligence body Mossad," al-Ahram said. "Information confirmed the defendant Azam Azam, 35, of Arab origin, who was sent by Mossad, gave the Egyptian citizen Emad eddin Abdel Hamid materials...that are used in espionage." Israel's charge d'affaires in Egypt, Jacob Gil, told Reuters on Monday that Azam, who had been working at a Cairo textile factory, was abducted when he returned to the Baron Hotel in the suburb of Medinet Nasr last Wednesday. "His father says people from security took him away. We checked this at a very high level and they know nothing about it," he said. The Egyptian newspaper al-Gomhuria said state security investigations confirmed that Mossad had lately sent to Cairo one of its "prominent members" to work with the Israeli textile firm Tefron. Egypt's interior ministry said it had no information on the case. "We can neither confirm, nor deny the reports," a ministry official told Reuters. "We know nothing about the case." Cairo newspapers described Hamid variously as an employee of a private company or the owner of a clothing factory. One said Azam recruited him to spy for Israel in return for money. Egypt in 1979 became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel.

83167>>0>> Borg-Warner Automotive Inc said Wednesday its Morse TEC operating subsidiary plans to invest about $16 million for equipment to begin high-volume production of powder metal sprockets by mid-1998. Internal powder metal sprocket production will provide the company with greater control over technical advancements and economics of timing system components as the market shifts to overhead-cam engine configurations and customers demand the technology. It said the new sprocket prodution equipment will be installed at its Ithaca, N.Y. plant and is expected to be fully operational by mid-1998. -- Chicago newsdesk 312 408-8787
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG, under fire in its court battle against rival Adam Opel AG and from a new company book detailing its Nazi past, had something to celebrate on Wednesday -- production of its 17 millionth Golf. The German carmaker said it took only 15 months for one million of the popular Golfs, the top selling car in Europe, to be produced since the 16 millionth car rolled off an assembly line on July 4, 1995. The record-setting car that was produced on Wednesday was a four-door Golf DTI in bright red that has been marked for export, VW said in a statement. The ceremony was a welcome relief for VW, which has been suffering from a series of public relations setbacks and is in a court battle with Opel and its parent General Motors Corp over industrial espionage charges. In addition, a new book published last week detailed the company's Nazi roots, prompting a top VW official to warn other carmakers not to use the book against it in advertising campaigns. Production of the Golf began in April 1974 and daily worldwide production now stands at 3,640 vehicles. The most are made at VW's main plant in Wolfsburg, while others are made in Brussels, Osnabrueck and Mosel, Germany, Mexico, South Africa and Slovakia, VW said. Of the 17 million Golfs that have so far been made, VW said 39 percent, or 6.6 million vehicles, were delivered in Germany, while 61 percent, or 10.4 million vehicles, were exported. VW said the top export markets for the Golf are the U.S., which has received 1.87 million vehicles, Italy with 1.51 million vehicles, France with 1.27 million vehicles and the U.K. with 735,000. Other top markets include Mexico with 588,000 vehicles, the Netherlands with 514,000, Austria with 513,000, Belgium with 462,000, South Africa with 419,000 and Switzerland with 400,000, VW said.
83167>>0>> The arraignment of a former Soviet KGB agent on conspiracy and espionage charges was scheduled to resume on Thursday as experts debated whether the United States could legally prosecute the man. Vladimir Galkin is accused of being a retired agent for the Committee for State Security in the Soviet Union, the now defunct KGB, who in 1991 allegedly tried to obtain secret information about the Star Wars programme or the Strategic Defence Initiative as it was officially known. The 50-year-old former spy, who retired in 1992 and did not conceal his previous occupation on a visa application, was arrested on Oct. 29 at New York's John F. Kennedy airport on the charges. His arrest has sparked anger in Moscow where Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) which sees it as a breach of an understanding between rival spy agencies not to persecute retired intelligence officers. The SVR has threatened to retaliate. "Indeed, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander," said Harvard Unversity Law School Professor Anne-Marie Slaughter. "Of course, the Russians could retaliate. They could arrest a CIA agent and try him under Russian law. That is if they're stupid enough to go there." Tufts Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy Professor Alfred Rubin agreed saying, "People can do to you whatever you can do to them." But the two international law experts took different views on whether U.S. espionage laws could apply to foreigners acting abroad. "The U.S. espionage act certainly applies to foreigners in this country and it applies to Americans abroad, but this is an application that is debatable. I'm not certain whether it makes sense at all," said Rubin. "There has been an expansion of U.S. laws as they apply abroad, especially in the antitrust area" he noted. Over the past 50 years, the U.S. Supreme Court has strengthened the hand of prosecutors trying to pursue allegations of anticompetitive conspiracies by foreign companies when their actions had a substantial impact on U.S. commerce. Slaughter said the expansion has also taken place in interpretations of "securities law, environmental laws and criminal laws" calling the prosecution of former Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega "just the most notorious case, but there have been others that are of less celebrated citizens." "This," she said, "could be considered a natural extension if it meets the doctrinal tests for whether the statute should apply abroad." While there is no U.S. statute of limitation on spy charges, there is yet another conflict for Galkin, the suspected spymaster for whom an Indian businessman worked. The first trial of the businessman, Aluru Prasad, ended in a mistrial. There has been speculation in the press that prosecutors need Galkin's testimony to successfully convict Prasad. But if he testifies, in return for a grant of immunity from U.S. prosecution, Galkin would violate Russian law which prohibits former intelligence officers from talking about their agents. "It will take a sophisticated judge," said Tuft's Rubin, who added, "Personally, I think he will probably shut up and trust the Russians to get him out of this."
83167>>0>> Germany's top prosecutor has warned companies they must tighten security precautions in the face of industrial espionage from Russia and eastern Europe which is costing them billions of dollars a year. Federal Prosecutor Kay Nehm said the end of the Cold War had reduced military and political tension between east and west but foreign intelligence services were more active than ever in trying to steal secrets from German companies. "The military confrontation has been resolved but the industrial situation remains largely unchanged," he told an audience of lawyers in Duesseldorf on Wednesday night. Nehm said one study had put the damage done to German industry by espionage at around eight billion marks ($5.31 billion) annually -- an estimate he called "very conservative". He said many foreign intelligence services were concentrating on industrial espionage to justify their continued existence as it offered considerable financial rewards. He singled out Russia as an example. "To try to hold onto their power and to increase it, Russian intelligence services are moving into new fields -- fields which pay for themselves," he said. The risks run by the classic agents of the past -- locating and then stealing or copying material and passing it on to a contact -- have largely disappeared in the high-technology world of espionage in the 1990s. "All these things can now be done at the touch of a button," Nehm said. He warned small and medium-sized firms that it was not just the industrial giants who were being targeted by foreign spies. "All sectors are at risk -- and not just the big companies but the smaller ones too," he said. "This is particularly the case because security precautions in these firms are often less developed, especially when it comes to data processing." Nehm singled out Russia and eastern Europe as the biggest threat but added the rapidly-growing economies of southeast Asia and communist countries such as North Korea and China were also interested in getting their hands on German know-how. Agents are not just interested in research which may have cost millions of marks to develop but also in general company strategy and competitors' bids for contracts being tendered. To infiltrate their targets, foreign intelligence services were placing agents in international organisations, setting up joint-ventures with German companies and even setting up bogus companies of their own, Nehm said. He warned business leaders to be particularly wary of former diplomats or people who used to work for foreign secret services as they often had the language skills and knowledge of Germany that made excellent agents. "This is not just a matter for individual companies but one which concerns the economic strength of the nation," he said. ($1=1.5059 Mark)

83167>>0>> Egypt will issue an official charge sheet next week against an Israeli man and an Egyptian citizen accused of spying, a public prosecution source said on Saturday. He said the prosecutor had questioned Azam Azam, an Israeli of Arab origin, and Egyptian national Emad eddin Abdel Hamid and would issue the charge sheet detailing the accusation on Monday or Tuesday. The source said Israeli embassy officials could visit Azam and he could have the lawyers he requested. Egyptian security sources have said Hamid confessed to spying for Israel and receiving spying equipment. Israel said Azam, 35, was innocent and demanded his release. Azam, chief mechanic at an Israeli-owned textile factory in Egypt, was arrested last week by Egyptian security authorities along with Hamid. Egyptian newspapers said they were accused of several charges, including espionage. Egypt in 1979 became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel.
83167>>0>> The CIA became suspicious of an employee who now faces charges of spying for Russia after he showed deception on lie-dectector tests and after it was discovered he had taken unexplained trips and made mysterious bank deposits. At at news conference at FBI headquarters Monday on the arrest of CIA officer Harold Nicholson, John Deutch, the director of central intelligence, said polygraph tests given the accused spy in late 1995 played a role in the case. "There was a whole series of analysis that was woven together of which the polygraph is a single important thread," Deutch said. "I don't want to belittle the polygraph. But ... I think it's incorrect to look at the polygraph as being the essential element here. "The analysis was complicated and it involved the simultaneous attention to a number of variables -- money, travel, security. So, I would not say that the polygraph was the initiating piece." FBI agent Michael Lonergan said in a 31-page affidavit that Nicholson, a 16-year CIA veteran who had access to highly sensitive secrets, had been given two polygraph tests in October 1995 as part of a routine security update. The exams found a strong probabilty Nicholson had been lying when asked if he was hiding involvement with or had any unauthorised contact with a foreign intelligence service. His alleged spying began in June 1994. During a third test in December 1995, the CIA examiner noted Nicholson appeared to be trying to manipulate the test by taking deep breaths before certain questions. The FBI agent said Nicholson stopped after a warning. In building the case, Lonergan said the FBI reviewed Nicholson's frequent-flyer records, financial records from 1994 through early 1996 and information furnished by the CIA. "The FBI uncovered a pattern of twice-yearly foreign travel, followed by unexplained deposits and payments to Nicholson's accounts," he said, The unexplained deposits, which followed trips abroad and an unauthorised meeting with Russian intelligence officers, totalled $120,000, Lonergan said. "The FBI has been unable to trace the source of this money to any legitimate source of income," he said. FBI officials also intercepted postcards Nicholson mailed to his handlers, recovered classified information from his laptop computer, observed him photocopying classified documents and found in his office numerous classified documents about Russia that were unrelated to his CIA duties. Lonergan said an audit in July of CIA computer information showed Nicholson was using his computer to conduct searches of databases for information on Russia. "This unauthorised activity led the CIA computer security personnel to list Nicholson as a 'surfer'," the agent said. Among the information the FBI believes Nicholson may have compromised were listings of CIA case officers posted abroad, including agents Nicholson may have instructed at a CIA special training centre. Nicholson has held posts in Romania and Malaysia and as an instructor at the CIA's training centre in Virginia teaching espionage tradecraft to agency personnel. He was most recently working in anti-terrorism. Lonergan said Nicholson may have given Moscow information summarizing what was obtained in the debriefing of Aldrich Ames -- another CIA employee who admitted spying for Moscow after being arrested in 1994. Lonergan's affidavit was filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, a Washington suburb. CIA headquarters is at Langley, another Virginia suburb of the capital.
83167>>0>> The U.S. government on Monday charged a veteran CIA officer with spying for Russia over the last two years, alleging he was photographing secret documents to sell to Moscow just six days ago. The suspect, Harold Nicholson, an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency for 16 years who held posts abroad and most recently worked in counter-terrorism, was accused of spying for Russia since June, 1994, in exchange for more than $100,000. "He was not motivated by ideology but by greed," the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Helen Fahey, who is in overall charge of prosecuting the case, told reporters. It was the first such case in the United States since the 1994 arrest of confessed CIA turncoat Aldrich Ames. Fahey said the Nicholson case was not related to Ames, who is now serving a life sentence. Nicholson faced a possible death sentence if any secrets he sold led to deaths or involved highly classified military matters, but Fahey said there was no such evidence yet. According to the charges, Nicholson, who had special clearance for access to highly sensitive information, photographed top-secret CIA documents about Russia just six days ago with the intent to deliver them to a Russian intelligence officer. In an affidavit, FBI agent Michael Lonergan charged that Nicholson "has been acting clandestinely, corruptly and illegally as an agent of the Russian Federation foreign intelligence service." Nicholson was taken into custody last Saturday at Dulles Airport as he was about to fly to Switzerland to meet his Russian handlers, Raymond Mislock, the agent in charge of the FBI's national security division, told reporters. He described Nicholson as having been unaware he was under suspicion. "He was completely suprised" when arrested, Mislock said, adding that Nicholson so far had given no information to the  authorities about his alleged spying. Court papers alleged that Nicholson had made $120,000 in unexplained bank deposits following trips abroad. Nicholson, who turned 46 on Sunday, had access to some of the nation's most sensitive intelligence secrets. He had been employed as an operations officer in various posts around the world and worked as an instructor at a classified CIA special training centre between 1994 and 1996. He appeared for about two minutes in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, just across the Potomac River from Washington, on early Monday. The CIA and the FBI have been hunting for a second possible Moscow spy inside the CIA since the Feb. 21, 1994, arrest of Ames, who was found guilty of selling some of the most sensitive U.S. secrets to Moscow over a 10-year period. A U.S. official said the damage done appeared to be nowhere "near the magnitude" caused by Ames, who unmasked about three dozen agents and perhaps hundreds of operations. "Any time you have a spy in your midst, it's bad news," the official said. "The good news is that he was caught, and he was caught quickly." John Deutch, the director of central intelligence, and Louis Freeh, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, were to hold a joint news conference to report on the Nicholson case at 1 p.m. EST (1800 GMT) at FBI headquarters. As a result of the Ames case, the CIA tightened security and counter-spy defences, requiring stepped-up financial disclosures from its employees among other things. In addition, Congress rewrote the law so that the CIA must immediately inform the FBI, which has the lead responsiblity for spy-catching in the U.S. government, when it suspects any loss of classified information. These post-Ames reforms played a "major role in wrapping up this case rapidly," a U.S. official said. The arrest of Ames, a 31-year career officer, set in motion changes in the U.S. intelligence community that have yet to run their course. James Woolsey resigned as CIA director in December 1994 after being sharply criticised in Congress over the handling of the Ames affair.
83167>>0>> A veteran CIA officer has been arrested on charges of passing classified information to Moscow for the past two years, allegedly motivated by cash, U.S. officials said on Monday. The suspect, whose name was under seal until an initial court appearance on Monday morning, was arrested by FBI agents on Saturday afternoon at Dulles Airport outside Washington as he was preparing to board a flight, an FBI spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman, Susan Lloyd of the FBI's Washington field office, declined to specify the suspect's destination when arrested, but said he apparently had been leaving on a long-planned trip and not attempting to flee. The suspect was to appear before federal magistrate Thomas Rawles Jones of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia at 11 a.m. (1600 GMT) in Alexandria, law enforcement officials said. The CIA and the FBI have been hunting for a second possible Moscow spy inside the CIA since the Feb. 21, 1994, arrest of Aldrich Ames, who is serving a life prison term for selling some of the most sensitive U.S. spy secrets to Moscow over a 10-year period. John Deutch, the director of central intelligence, and Louis Freeh, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, will give details of the case at 1 p.m. EST (1800 GMT) at FBI headquarters, FBI spokesman Bill Carter said. The person arrested in the new case appeared to have been spying for Moscow for about two years, a U.S. official said. He said the damage done appeared to be nowhere "near the magnitude" caused by Ames, who unmasked about three dozen agents and perhaps hundreds of operations. "Any time you have a spy in your midst, it's bad news," the official said. "The good news is that he was caught, and he was caught quickly." Justice Department officials said the suspect was a 16-year veteran of the CIA whose job included training spy agency employees. The motive for the alleged espionage was money, one official said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Chesnut, who is prosecuting the case, said the initial court hearing would determine whether the suspect had a lawyer, inform him of his rights and go over the nature of the charges and maximum penalties. U.S. Attorney Helen Fahey was to hold a news conference at 11:45 a.m. EST (1645 GMT) at her office next to the court to make public the complaint in the case and a lengthy FBI affidavit, Chesnut said. The New York Times said on Monday that the officer had served overseas and had access to secret material on a wide range of issues involving Russia and the former Soviet Union's Cold War satellite states. The arrest of Ames, a 31-year career officer, set in motion changes in the U.S. intelligence community that have yet to run their course. James Woolsey resigned as CIA director in December 1994 after being sharply criticised in Congress for his handling of failings that let Ames spy for Moscow under the CIA's nose for nearly a decade.

83167>>0>> A Frankfurt court will decide this week whether to hand over to U.S. authorities the results of a German investigation into allegations of industrial espionage against senior Volkswagen AG executives. A Frankfurt appellate court spokesman said on Monday a decision on a request by the U.S. Department of Justice and FBI for data from the German probe into VW executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua "would come in the course of the week". Volkswagen AG has filed a lawsuit in the Frankfurt court to try to prevent information concerning Lopez and other top VW executives collected by German prosecutors from being sent to U.S. investigators, court spokesman Wolfgang Frank said. U.S. authorities began their own independent criminal investigation into the allegations of spying in 1993, shortly after Lopez abruptly quit Opel, a unit of General Motors Corp, to join Wolfsburg-based VW, the largest carmaker in Europe. VW denies any wrongdoing and has continued to support Lopez. Lopez has been under investigation for allegedly taking confidential documents from Opel and GM, which have waged a four-year legal battle in the U.S. and Germany against him. VW on Monday said a German court had also set a date to resume reviewing the allegations Opel made about the alleged theft of secret documents when Lopez and others joined VW. VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said that the labour court in Braunschweig, Germany, had set September 23, 1997 for the case to be resumed. VW had sought to have the U.S. lawsuit dismissed because it was similar to the legal battle in the German labour court. It wanted the case settled in its home country. "It won't affect it immediately because there are different legal cultures. But it will affect the credibility of Opel because their point is that they had to go to Detroit to seek justice," Kocks said. "Now they have the chance to do it in Germany," he said. "Our perspective is that they are angry but they do not have any evidence. This is a smear campaign." Lopez, a Basque renowned for his ability to streamline production and cut carmaking costs, established innovative working practices at VW that helped the carmaker return to profitability. A lawyer for Lopez said in early November that he expected German prosecutors to file industrial spying charges by the end of the year against Lopez. He is also the target of a civil lawsuit in the United States filed by GM against senior VW officials, including VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech. The lawyer said he expected the German charges to relate to allegations that Lopez and others took secret plans related to the design of a super-efficient manufacturing plan called "Plant X" that GM had under development. Three other VW executives in the German criminal probe, who have been identified as Jose Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez and Rosario Piazza, left Opel shortly after Lopez defected to VW and allegedly helped bring documents to VW, he said. Volkswagen has suffered a series of legal defeats in its battle against GM in recent weeks. A U.S. court refused in October to throw out the civil charges filed by GM and a Frankfurt court rejected in early November a 10 million mark ($6.64 million) defamation lawsuit against statements made by GM and Opel executives about VW. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> German carmaker Volkswagen AG said on Monday that a German court has set a date to resume reviewing allegations by carmaker Adam Opel AG that former Opel executives took along secret documents when they joined VW. VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said that the labour court in Braunschweig, Germany, has set a new date for September 23, 1997, for the case to be resumed. A court spokesman also confirmed that the labour court in Braunschweig approved restarting the procedure. VW has been hoping to get the case in Germany resumed to help clear its name after Opel and parent General Motors Corp alleged that VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua took the documents when he left to join VW in 1993. GM has filed a civil lawsuit in U.S. federal district court in Detroit alleging VW with industrial spying and racketeering. VW had sought to have the U.S. lawsuit dismissed because it was similiar to the legal battle in the German labour court. "It won't affect it immediately because there are different legal cultures. But it will affect the credibility of Opel because their point is that they had to go to Detroit to seek justice," Kocks said. "Now they have the chance to do it in Germany," he said. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

A U.S. court refused in October to throw out the civil charges filed by GM and a Frankfurt court rejected in early November a 10 million mark ($6.64 million) defamation lawsuit against statements made by GM and Opel executives about VW. Opel issued a statement on Monday saying that VW's support of Lopez was "highly unusual and has corresponding implications for the reputation of the German business community." The carmaker, which is based in suburban Frankfurt, said it wanted VW executives to clarify their support for Lopez under oath during testimony in the U.S. civil lawsuit.
83167>>0>> A Frankfurt court will decide this week whether to give U.S. authorities the results of an investigation by German prosecutors into allegations of industrial espionage against senior Volkswagen AG executives, a court said on Monday. A Frankfurt appellate court spokesman said a decision on the request by the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI for information from the probe into VW executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua "would come in the course of the week". Volkswagen AG has filed a lawsuit in the Frankfurt court to try to prevent information concerning Lopez and other top VW executives collected by German prosecutors from being sent to U.S. investigators, court spokesman Wolfgang Frank said. U.S. authorities began their own independent criminal investigation into the allegations of spying in 1993 shortly after Lopez abruptly quit Opel, a unit of General Motors Corp., to join Wolfsburg-based VW, the largest carmaker in Europe. Lopez has been under investigation for allegedly taking confidential documents from Opel and GM, which have waged a nearly four-year legal battle in the U.S. and Germany against him. VW has vehemently denied the charges and VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech has said he would support Lopez despite the criminal investigation. Lopez, a Basque renowned for his ability to streamline production and cut carmaking costs, established innovative working practices at VW that helped the carmaker return to profitability. A lawyer for Lopez said in early November that he expected German prosecutors to file industrial spying charges by the end of the year against Lopez. He is also the target of a civil lawsuit in the United States filed by GM against senior VW officials, including Piech. The lawyer said he expected the German charges to relate to allegations that Lopez and others took secret plans related to the design of a super-efficient manufacturing plan called "Plant X" that GM had under development.

83167>>0>> Russia said on Tuesday the arrest of a former CIA station chief on charges of selling secrets to Moscow was an internal U.S. matter and refused to comment. "I have no comment to make on this matter," foreign ministry spokesman Mikhail Demurin told a regular news briefing. "An American citizen has been arrested by the U.S. authorities. It is an internal affair of that country and we have nothing to do with it," he added. Washington said on Monday it had arrested an employee of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for selling secrets to Russia for at least two years, including compromising information about U.S. spies about to be sent abroad. The suspect, Harold Nicholson, a 16-year CIA veteran who had been chief of station in Romania and deputy chief in Malaysia, was charged with spying for Moscow since June 1994 in exchange for more than $100,000 in cash. In a separate espionage incident last week, Moscow angrily threatened retaliatory measures against the United States over its detention of a former Soviet KGB spy, Vladimir Galkin. Galkin, who had given full details of his previous employment on his visa application, was arrested on October 29 and accused of trying to obtain secret information on the Star Wars programme in 1991. Washington later released him after the personal intervention of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Russia said the United States had violated an unwritten international code allowing retired agents to travel freely. Earlier this year, in a graphic reminder that espionage is flourishing despite the end of the Cold War, a Russian official accused of spying for Britain prompted a tit-for-tat expulsion row in which London and Moscow each expelled four diplomats.

83167>>0>> The head of Ecuador's central bank said Wednesday the International Monetary Fund has expressed its support of planned economic reforms. "They are very impressed by the reforms we are looking at," Augusto de la Torre, general manager of the central bank, told Reuters. "The plan includes ambitious reforms. There is nothing the IMF can oppose." He added that the IMF technical analysts expressed no objections to the part of the government's plan to peg the sucre to the dollar, because "the IMF wants to give its support."   Finance Minister Pablo Concha said on Monday the government's economic plan due to be released on Sunday will include the introduction of a convertibility plan. De la Torre explained that the IMF is interested in the proposed fiscal discipline, and in economic reforms that will foster growth. The central bank head's statements came a day after a government official said that some IMF personnel had opposed the fixed exchange rate plan because Ecuador will not be able to sustain such a regime. Ecuador has a fiscal deficit of four percent of gross domestic product and is expected to have an inflation rate of 18 percent and four percent economic growth next year. -- Gustavo Oviedo, Quito Newsroom, 5932 258433
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG  faces a critical week in its fight against rival Opel AG as a German court is set to decide whether to turn over German prosecution materials to their U.S. counterparts also probing the German carmaker. A Frankfurt appellate court said this week it would decide whether to hand over German prosecutor documents on VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and other suspects to the U.S. Justice Department. Lopez, a Basque, is being probed by German authorities for allegedly taking along secret documents when he quit Opel and parent company General Motors Corp in 1993 to join VW. U.S. prosecutors began an investigation shortly after Lopez and three of his associates joined VW and made the request for the German documents more than two years ago. VW has fought the document transfer by saying the rights of Lopez and other suspects would be violated and that German courts should have jurisdiction over the overall issue. Lopez's German lawyer said earlier in November that he expected German prosecutors in Darmstadt to soon file criminal charges related to industrial spying against his client. Prosecutors have said a decision would be made by year-end. If the Frankfurt court complies with the U.S. request for the information, the files could then be put before a U.S. grand jury in Detroit, the hometown of GM, that is also investigating the abrupt switch of Lopez and other executives to Volkswagen. "The decision whether to turn over these documents to the U.S. authorities is crucial and critical for VW," said a legal source familiar with the court fight between the two carmakers. "It seems as though people have forgotten about the U.S. grand jury investigation and that Lopez and others, as well as VW itself, could face criminal charges," the source said. "People have apparently underestimated the U.S. grand jury." VW, which has denied the allegations, said this week it was fully complying with U.S. prosecutors investigating Lopez -- as it has with the German probe. "Volkswagen has supported the U.S. investigation as much as it has the German investigation," VW said in a statement. VW has suffered a series of legal setbacks in recent weeks, including a U.S. district court in Detroit rejecting VW's attempts to have the lawsuit -- which include racketeering charges based on organised crime statutes -- dismissed. In addition to Lopez, the U.S. lawsuit filed by GM names, among others, VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech. The Detroit federal court is scheduled to issue a written decision by November 26 on the inclusion of the racketeering charges, which are based on RICO statutes initially used to fight the mafia and whose use has been expanded. Legal experts familiar with U.S. civil lawsuits said GM getting a U.S. jury verdict in its favour on racketeering charges could see the carmaker facing hefty damages.

83167>>0>> UEFA's technical committee on Wednesday unanimously backed a move to set aside 10 days every second month solely for international matches. Two international fixtures would be scheduled within each 10-day period over a four-year cycle. The technical committee's conclusions will be considered by UEFA's executive committee. The proposal recognises the concerns of the National Coaches Convention, which warned at a meeting in September that national sides and national identities needed to be protected in the face of a growing number of domestic and European club fixtures. Many countries have already adopted the 10-day policy for the current qualifying matches for the 1998 World Cup finals in France. UEFA's technical committee also unanimously opposed the use of the "golden goal " to decide a match in extra-time and said the number of teams qualifying for the final phase of the European championship should be left at 16.
83167>>0>> The unmasking of another alleged Moscow spy in its ranks dealt the CIA a huge new blow, possibly exposing dozens of undercover agents and details of how the U.S. espionage agency does business around the world. What may be even worse for Washington, the case of alleged turncoat Harold Nicholson may scare away foreigners targeted for recruitment and dry up contacts with private U.S. citizens who provide information, intelligence professionals said. "People are going to be a little bit leery of playing closely with Uncle Sam because they fear that there might be another mole hidden there (inside the CIA)," said David Whipple of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers, a 35-year veteran of the CIA's operations directorate. Nicholson, 46, was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation last Saturday and charged with selling secrets, including the identity of fellow clandestine CIA officers, to Moscow for at least two years. An instructor at the Central Intelligence Agency's training camp for undercover operatives in Virginia, he may have given away recruitment techniques, spy skills and tricks and agent-handling procedures, U.S. officials fear. Overseas recruiting is a key part of what CIA operatives like Nicholson do to penetrate hostile governments, criminal gangs and guerrilla groups. Groups targeted include drug runners, nuclear proliferators and those who would steal U.S. national security secrets. "Anything that tends to dry up (CIA) sources is a body blow, and this has to have that effect," said Marvin Ott, a former CIA analyst and Senate Intelligence Committee staff member who is now a professor at the National War College. U.S. officials fear Nicholson also turned over the names of CIA recruits he helped train from 1994 until four months ago. CIA Director John Deutch said on Wednesday that "there is no question" that the discovery of his alleged betrayal had devastated morale at the agency. Nicholson allegedly began his double-crossing only weeks after the arrest of CIA officer Aldrich Ames in February, 1994. Ames pleaded guilty to selling out to the KGB every top Soviet and East European military and intelligence officer secretly working for the CIA and the FBI. Unlike in the Ames case, where at least 10 of those foreigners were reportedly killed, the CIA says it knows of no deaths tied to Nicholson, who worked in the Philippines, Thailand, Japan, Romania and Malaysia in his 16-year career. But the task of persuading someone to spy against their own country, always difficult, has now been complicated by a possible perception that the CIA may have chronic problems keeping its secrets. The FBI says it found a computer diskette in Nicholson's car containing seven summary reports about CIA "access agents," private citizens such as business people who briefed the agency after they had traveled to Russia. Paul Joyal, who helped develop and enforce counter-spy procedures as director of security at the Senate Intelligence Committee from 1985 to 1989, said Nicholson's ability to get such files unrelated to any legitimate "need to know" pointed to a glaring flaw in CIA security. "It shows a lack of proper compartmentation," Joyal said, referring to the basic spy agency practice of limiting employees' access to data needed to do their jobs. The CIA declined comment, citing ongoing investigations. Stunned by a torrent of leaks of highly classified intelligence reports to the Washington Times newspaper, Defense Secretary William Perry warned in July that such disclosures could lead other countries' intelligence agencies "to believe the U.S. to be an unreliable collaborator." The CIA's task of signing up foreigners has also been complicated by the end of the Cold War. Previously there had been "an ideological appeal to be made that was very powerful," said Ott. "It could persuade someone that their higher loyalty was not to the Soviet Union but to certain values," an argument that may no longer apply, he added.
83167>>0>> Despite CIA and FBI boasts that their cooperation led to the arrest of an accused Moscow spy in the CIA, a U.S. official admitted on Thursday the two agencies bungled another recent Russian espionage case. "I don't think anyone would claim that was a triumph of cooperation," Associate Attorney General John Schmidt said of the espionage case in which U.S. charges had to be suddenly dropped against former Soviet KGB agent Vladimir Galkin. A week ago the Justice Department, citing the "national interest," was forced to drop spy charges against Galkin after CIA Director John Deutch warned that Moscow would retaliate. Galkin was arrested by FBI agents on October 29 at John F. Kennedy airport in New York on charges of conspiring to steal top-secret information about the "Star Wars" defence programme, a space-based missile-defence programme initiated under President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. The Justice Department said the CIA had been told in advance of the proposed move on Galkin and raised concerns, but did not state sufficent objection to block the arrest. Moscow protested and the episode created a diplomatic embarrassment resolved by Galkin's release. He had retired from espionage work some time ago and, in any case, agents who operate from abroad as he had are customarily expelled rather than arrested if they enter the target country. At a Justice Department news briefing, Schmidt said that episode was "kind of a footnote in what is the larger pattern of effective, ongoing cooperation" now being pressed by Deutch and FBI Director Louis Freeh. In announcing on Monday the arrest of veteran CIA officer Harold Nicholson on charges of spying for Moscow for cash since June 1994, both Deutch and Freeh proudly cited "the unprecedented level of cooperation" between their agencies. The Central Intelligence Agency, which is charged with running intelligence operations abroad, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is supposed to guard the United States against foreign espionage, have a history of friction and rivalry as they pursue sometimes overlapping operations. A lack of cooperation between them hampered the investigation of CIA turncoat Aldrich Ames, who pleaded guilty in 1994 to spying for Moscow since 1985. In the Galkin case, Schmidt said there was a question of whether the matter had reached the "appropriate levels" within the various agencies. He added: "It may be more an internal matter for the agencies than something that really relates to the issue of cooperation between them." Schmidt also rejected complaints by Nicholson's defence lawyer, Jonathan Shapiro, that the public comments by Deutch and Freeh would prevent his client from getting a fair trial. "These are matters of large public importance and when events like this occur I think that people in those kinds of positions (agency directors) have an obligation to talk about them publicly," he said. The two have gone to unusual lengths to showcase FBI-CIA harmony in appearances since the Nicholson arrest, including a joint interview on CNN on Wednesday in which they expressed confidence the government has a strong case against him.
83167>>0>> Egypt's counter-espionage service has arrested a 47-year-old Egyptian man on suspicion of selling military information to Mossad, the Israeli secret service, the government newspaper al-Ahram said on Friday. It said the man, Samir Osman, met Mossad agents in Greece, Turkey and Hungary or by swimming to Israel underwater with scuba diving equipment from the border resort of Taba. Osman was said to have confessed to providing Mossad with information about the Egyptian navy and about the place where he served in the Egyptian military. The newspaper said the arrest was part of a counter- espionage operation which started in October. Osman was initially remanded in custody for 15 days and this has since been extended by a further 45 days, it added. It did not link Osman with the case of Israeli textile engineer Azam Azam, who was arrested on November 5 on suspicion of spying on Egypt for his country. An alleged Egyptian accomplice is in custody on suspicion of helping Azam. Israel has denied Azam is a spy but Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak insists that he is and has rejected Israeli appeals that the Egyptian authorities release him. Al-Ahram said a search of Osman's flat turned up four passports and incriminating documents. Under questioning he confessed to meeting Mossad agents on many occasions and sending his information to a post office box in Greece. It said he also frequented the Israeli embassy and the Israeli Academic Centre in Cairo and visited Israel openly on the pretext of seeking work. "The public prosecutor has filed several charges, including giving information to a foreign state with the aim of damaging Egypt's political and military position and receiving money from abroad," the newspaper said. It said the case was expected to be referred to the military judiciary for investigation and court martial proceedings.
83167>>0>> A Frankfurt appellate court took a decision on Friday on handing over German prosecution documents on Volkswagen AG to the U.S. Justice Department but declined to publicise it until next week. Court spokesman Wolfgang Frank said the decision was being sent to the parties involved before being made public. The Justice Department has asked for documents on VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and other suspects in a legal fight against VW's rival, Opel AG. Lopez, a Spaniard, is being probed by German authorities for allegedly taking along secret documents when he quit Opel and parent company General Motors Corp in 1993 to join VW. U.S. prosecutors began an investigation shortly after Lopez and three of his associates joined VW and made the request for the German documents more than two years ago.

83167>>0>> Lawyers representing Volkswagen AG manager Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua said on Saturday that a court in Frankfurt ruled on Friday they would have to hand over key documents at the request of the U.S. A spokesman for lawyer Juergen Toschke, who is representing the VW manager accused of industrial espionage, said the court had ruled that certain documents must be made available to U.S. authorities if requested by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Justice Department.   The ruling, which was intitially concealed after Friday's court session, applied to a study by auditors KPMG, the protocol of witnesses statements and the statement of the defence, the spokesman said. The Justice Department has asked for documents on Lopez, VW's production chief de Arriortua and other suspects in a legal fight against VW's rival Opel AG. Lopez, a Spaniard, is being probed by German authorities for allegedly taking along secret documents when he quit Opel and parent company General Motors Corp in 1993 to join VW.   U.S. prosecutors began an investigation shortly after Lopez and three of his associates joined VW and made the request for the German documents more than two years ago. Court spokesman Wolfgang Frank said on Friday the decision was being sent to the parties involved before being made public. VW has fought the document transfer by saying the rights of Lopez and other suspects would be violated and that German courts should have jurisdiction over the overall issue.   Lopez's German lawyer said earlier in November that he expected German prosecutors in Darmstadt to soon file criminal charges related to industrial spying against his client. Prosecutors have said a decision would be made by year-end. If the Frankfurt court complies with the U.S. request for the information, the files could be put before a U.S. grand jury in Detroit, the hometown of GM, that is also investigating the abrupt switch of Lopez and other executives to Volkswagen.   VW has suffered a series of legal setbacks in recent weeks, including a U.S. district court in Detroit rejecting VW's attempts to have the lawsuit -- which include racketeering charges based on organised crime statutes -- dismissed. In addition to Lopez, the U.S. lawsuit filed by GM names, among others, VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech. The Detroit federal court is scheduled to issue a written decision by November 26 on the inclusion of the racketeering charges, which are based on RICO statutes initially used to fight the mafia and whose use has been expanded.   Legal experts familiar with U.S. civil lawsuits said GM getting a U.S. jury verdict in its favour on racketeering charges could see the carmaker facing hefty damages.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG is secretly negotiating with General Motors Corp to reach an out-of-court settlement on charges it engaged in industrial espionage, Germany's Spiegel magazine reported on Sunday. Spiegel will say in its Monday edition, released in advance, that VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen has met with GM general council chief John Smale in Detroit to consider a settlement of the legal fight. Volkswagen spokesman Klaus Kocks would not comment on the report. The case has been centred on VW executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua who has been under investigation for allegedly taking confidential documents from Opel, an unit of GM, and GM itself in 1993 when he joined VW, the largest car maker in Europe. The magazine reported that VW was seeking an agreement with GM because recent court decisions related the case have not gone in its favour and because the German car making company faces potential judgements against in the U.S. totalling billions of dollars. VW also thought that American executives would be more willing to reach an agreement than GM and Opel management in Germany who have been closely involved in the protracted legal battle, the magazine said. The report follows a string of court judgements against VW in its legal fight with GM as well as with U.S. authorities who began their own independent criminal investigation into the allegations of spying. A spokesman for lawyer Juergen Toschke, who is representing Lopez, said on Saturday the court had ruled that certain documents must be made available to U.S. authorities if requested by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Justice Department. The ruling, which was intitially concealed after Friday's court session, applied to a study by auditors KPMG, the protocol of witnesses statements and the statement of the defence, the spokesman said. The Justice Department has asked for documents on Lopez and others in a legal fight against VW's rival Opel AG. VW has fought the document transfer by saying the rights of Lopez and other people would be violated and that German courts should have jurisdiction over the overall issue. Lopez's German lawyer said earlier in November that he expected German prosecutors in Darmstadt to soon file criminal charges related to industrial spying against his client. Prosecutors have said a decision would be made by year-end. If the Frankfurt court complies with the U.S. request for the information, the files could be put before a U.S. grand jury in Detroit, the hometown of GM. VW also suffered a legal setback in the U.S. several weeks ago when a U.S. district court in Detroit rejected VW's attempts to have the lawsuit -- which include racketeering charges based on organised crime statutes -- dismissed. In addition to Lopez, the U.S. lawsuit filed by GM names, among others, VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech. The Detroit federal court is scheduled to issue a written decision by November 26 on the inclusion of the racketeering charges, which are based on RICO statutes initially used to fight the mafia and whose use has been expanded.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG is secretly negotiating with General Motors Corp. to reach an out-of-court settlement on charges it engaged in industrial espionage, Germany's Spiegel magazine reported Sunday. Spiegel will say in its Monday edition, released in advance, that VW Supervisory Board Chairman Klaus Liesen has met with GM executive John Smale in Detroit to consider a settlement of the legal fight. Volkswagen spokesman Klaus Kocks would not comment on the report. The case has been centred on VW executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who has been under investigation for allegedly taking confidential documents from Opel, an unit of GM, and GM itself in 1993 when he joined VW, the largest car maker in Europe. The magazine reported that VW was seeking an agreement with GM because recent court decisions related to the case have not gone in its favour and because the German company faces potential judgments against it in the United States totalling billions of dollars. VW also thought that American executives would be more willing to reach an agreement than GM and Opel management in Germany, who have been closely involved in the protracted legal battle, the magazine said. The report follows a string of court judgments against VW in its legal fight with GM as well as with U.S. authorities who have begun their own independent criminal investigation into the allegations of spying. A spokesman for lawyer Juergen Toschke, who is representing Lopez, said Saturday a court had ruled that certain documents must be made available to U.S. authorities if requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Justice Department. The ruling, which was intitially concealed after Friday's court session, applied to a study by auditors KPMG, the protocol of witnesses statements and the statement of the defence, the spokesman said. The Justice Department has asked for documents on Lopez and others in a legal fight against VW's rival Opel AG. VW has fought the document transfer by saying the rights of Lopez and other people would be violated and that German courts should have jurisdiction over the overall issue.
83167>>0>> General Motors Corp declined to comment Monday on a published report that a top official has held talks with Volkswagen AG aimed at settling a civil lawsuit that alleges VW officials stole secrets from GM. "That's a subject I'm not going to get into," said GM spokesman John Mueller. According to a story in the German magazine Spiegel, VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen met in Detroit with John Smale, chairman of GM's executive committee and the former non-executive chairman of the automaker.   VW is seeking an out-of-court settlement, according to the report, because of recent decisions in both civil and criminal courts that have gone against the German automaker. GM filed a civil suit in U.S. District Court in Detroit last March, alleging that VW's production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and several other VW executives stole trade secrets when they left GM for VW in March of 1993. In October, U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds ruled GM can proceed with its suit in the U.S.  VW had asked to have the suit dismissed.   Edmunds also ruled that Lopez, along with VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech and management board member Jens Neumann, should remain defendants in GM's civil lawsuit. VW had argued that Piech and Neumann should be dropped from the suit because GM has not provided proof they were directly involved in the alleged events.  GM claims the two men conspired with Lopez to steal secrets, including parts pricing data, future product plans and proprietary manufacturing techniques. A spokesman for Edmunds declined to comment Monday on a report that she will issue a ruling Tuesday that allows GM to include charges filed under the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act against VW. Edmunds heard arguments on that motion in late October. If a jury found VW guilty of violating the so-called RICO statute, it could force VW to pay triple damages. Last week, a German court ruled that evidence from a three-year German criminal investigation of Lopez and other former GM workers now at VW could be turned over to the U.S. Justice Department.
83167>>0>> German carmaker Adam Opel AG accused Volkswagen AG Monday of delaying a U.S. criminal probe of top VW executives on industrial spying charges by blocking the forwarding of documents for a year. Opel confirmed that a Frankfurt appellate court ordered that information collected by German prosecutors be sent to the U.S. Justice Department, fulfilling a request Washington made some two years ago, which VW had sought to block. The Frankfurt court said Friday the judge's decision had already been given to VW and Opel, a unit of General Motors Corp., and would be released publicly this week. The documents to be turned over -- including 200 transcripts of witness interviews and a complete report by accounting firm KPMG -- are linked to the German criminal probe of VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. Lopez's German lawyer said in early November that he expected German prosecutors to file criminal charges related to industrial spying against Lopez soon for allegedly taking secret documents when he abruptly left GM in 1993 for VW. "The ruling by the Frankfurt appellate court demonstrates that VW has once again failed in an attempt to impede a judicial clarification of the VW/Lopez case as well as the criminal prosecution in Germany and the U.S.," Opel said. VW, which has denied the industrial spying charges, had fought the document transfer by saying the rights of Lopez and other VW officials under investigation would be violated. VW declined to comment on the Opel statement. The German documents will be given to U.S. prosecutors reviewing criminal allegations against Lopez and top VW officials, including VW Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech, before a U.S. grand jury in Detroit. Under U.S. law, a criminal indictment can be filed against both a corporation and also the responsible individual members of that company's management. In addition, Opel and VW both declined comment Monday on a weekend magazine report in Germany saying they were in secret negotiations to reach an out-of-court settlement in the U.S. civil lawsuit GM filed against VW in a Detroit federal court. A GM spokesman in Detroit also declined to comment on the report in Spiegel magazine. Spiegel reported that VW Supervisory Board Chairman Klaus Liesen had met with GM executive John Smale in Detroit to consider a deal to end the American legal fight between the two major carmakers. "That's a subject I'm not going to get into," said GM spokesman John Mueller. Smale, the former non-executive chairman of GM, is chairman of the automaker's executive committee. GM filed a civil suit in U.S. District Court in Detroit last March alleging that Lopez and several other VW executives stole trade secrets when they left GM for VW in March 1993. VW could face damages of hundreds of millions of dollars, possibly billions, if GM were to win the civil suit, officials familiar with GM's lawsuit against VW said. The Wolfsburg-based carmaker is likely to suffer more bad news soon regarding the fight in Detroit, GM's hometown. U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds was reported ready to issue a ruling Tuesday that allows GM to include charges filed under the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act against VW. Edmunds heard arguments on that motion last month but a spokesman declined to comment Monday on the report. If a jury found VW guilty of violating the so-called RICO statute, it could force VW to pay triple damages.

83167>>0>> A federal judge ruled Tuesday that General Motors Corp.'s industrial espionage lawsuit against Volkswagen AG can proceed under U.S. racketeering law, opening the German automaker to much higher potential damages. U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds, in a written order, denied VW's motion to dismiss GM's claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). It was the latest in a series of blows the judge has dealt to VW in the case. If a jury finds that VW fiancially damaged GM through the theft of trade secrets, VW could face triple damages under the RICO law, leading to a potential payout in the billions of dollars, industry sources said. "This certainly increases the potential recovery for GM, so it enhances the settlement value," said Patrick Keenan, a law professor at the University of Detroit Mercy. "The purpose of RICO is to add one more big hammer to GM's case." In a long-running saga, GM has accused its fiery former purchasing chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and others of stealing confidential documents when they left GM to join VW in March 1993. GM claims the stolen data, which included product plans, parts prices and super-efficient manufacturing techniques, unfairly allowed VW to slash its costs, causing GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG, unspecified financial damages. The RICO statute, which has been widely used to prosecute organized crime in the United States, is aimed at thwarting conspiracies and enterprises that engage in a pattern of fraud or other criminal racketeering activities. GM based its RICO claim on allegations that Lopez, VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech and other top executives conspired to steal the GM secrets and profit from them. GM said they used VW's corporate jet to transport the documents to VW's guest villa in Wolfsburg, Germany, where the documents were copied into VW computers and shredded. While Edmunds did not consider the merits of GM's claims, she said they warranted further consideration under the RICO statute. "Although the complaint only alleges two victims, GM and Opel, the compaint alleges multiple schemes and multiple predicate acts," Edmunds wrote in the order. Reacting to the ruling, GM said in a statement that Edmunds' order meant its most serious allegations would be presented in open court with witnesses under oath. "It also means that we are yet another step closer to a remedy for the substantial damages we suffered when Lopez was lured away from GM and defected to VW with our trade secrets," GM spokesman John Mueller said. He declined to comment on media reports in recent days that VW has held secret talks with GM about settling the case. Volkswagen also has declined to comment on the reports. But industry sources in Germany said the increasing threat of a U.S. judgment against VW has prompted more talks between the two companies. "The situation for VW is so threatening that they are trying to demonstrate to their shareholders that they are seeking to limit the damages," said one source, who asked not to be identified. In addition, Lopez and other executives who followed him to VW remain the focus of criminal investigations in the United States and Germany. Lopez' lawyer said in February that he expected German prosecutors to soon file criminal charges against him. In August 1993, Opel said any settlement of the matter would have to include a public apology, the resignation of Lopez and a substantial payout for damages to the automaker. VW's lead U.S. attorney, James Denvir, said in a statement that Edmunds' ruling "has nothing to do with the merits of the allegations, but merely whether they are legally sufficient, being taken as true, to state a claim." Edmunds is expected to meet with GM and VW lawyers in the case on Dec. 5 to set a schedule for disclosure of facts and evidence before the case goes to trial. GM stock rose 12.5 cents to $58.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
83167>>0>> German carmaker Adam Opel AG said on Tuesday that it felt vindicated by a U.S. federal court's decision to allow its parent General Motors to sue carmaker Volkswagen AG under racketeering law. "The decision proves that Opel and GM can establish an appropriate legal basis for its claims against the defendants," Opel said in a statement on Tuesday evening. A federal judge in Detroit earlier denied Volkswagen's motion to dismiss racketeering claims by GM. U.S. District Court Judge Nancy Edmunds said in a written order that GM's complaint against VW adequately meets the the standard needed to proceed under the RICO law, or the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act. If a U.S. jury finds VW financially damaged GM through the theft of trade secrets, VW could be forced to pay triple damages if found guilty -- and could lead to a payout in the billions of dollars, sources said. Opel's demands for any settlement, made in August 1993, are a public apology, the resignation of VW executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and a substantial payout for damages to the carmaker. Lopez, a Spaniard, and three other former GM executives now at VW, are under investigation in Germany and the U.S. for stealing secret data when they left Opel for GM in March 1993. Media reports in recent days have said VW has held secret talks with GM aimed at settling the civil lawsuit that GM filed last March alleging some VW officials took the secret documents when they left the company. Both German-based Volkswagen and Opel have declined comment on the reports. But industry sources in Germany said the threat of a judgement against VW in the U.S. civil lawsuit is rising and has prompted more talks between the two companies. "The situation for VW is so threatening that they are trying to demonstrate to their shareholders that they are seeking to limit the damages," said one source who asked not to be identified. Contact between the two carmakers -- including a reported meeting in Detroit between VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen and GM executive committeee chairman John Smale -- may lead to a deal in the coming weeks to months, the sources said. Another factor favouring VW seeking a deal was Lopez's lawyer saying in early November that he expected German prosecutors to soon file criminal charges against his client. In addition, a U.S. grand jury investigation in Detroit into VW and its top executives will also now have the chance to review documents from the German criminal investigation after a Frankfurt court approved last Friday the transfer of documents. Under U.S. law, criminal indictments can be filed against both a corporation and also the responsible individual members of that company's management. Lopez and the others joined Volkswagen after it reported a massive one billion mark loss and then implemented innovative production practices that have since led to hefty profits. GM has alleged that secret production plans for its "Plant X" were used by VW to build a new plant in Brazil. Other documents related to purchasing contracts were also allegedly stolen by Lopez and three other former GM employees now at VW. VW has vehemently denied the charges.
83167>>0>> A federal judge Tuesday denied Volkswagen AG's motion to dismiss racketeering claims by General Motors Corp., opening the German automaker to potentially higher damages in GM's U.S. civil lawsuit. U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds said in a written order that GM's complaint alleging VW stole confidential documents adequately met the standard needed to proceed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO). If a jury finds VW fiancially damaged GM through the theft of trade secrets, VW could face triple damages under the RICO law. The statute, which has been widely used to prosecute organised crime in the United States, requires proof of an ongoing conspiracy or enterprise that aims to commit fraud or other criminal acts. GM filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in March alleging its former purchasing chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and several others stole confidential documents when they left GM to join VW in 1993. GM claims the stolen documents, which included information on future product plans, parts prices and manufacturing techniques, unfairly allowed VW to reduce its costs, causing GM unspecified financial damage. Under the RICO law, GM claimed that Volkswagen, Lopez, VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech and other top executives participated in a conspiracy to steal the documents and transport them to Germany. While Edmunds did not consider the merits of GM's claims, she said they should be considered under the RICO statute. "Although the complaint only alleges two victims, GM and Opel, the compaint alleges multiple schemes and multiple predicate acts," Edmunds wrote in the order. Adam Opel AG is GM's German subsidiary. GM has alleged, "Defendants schemed to steal boxes of trade secrets, to transport the documents to Europe, to copy them into VW's computers, to destroy the evidence and to engage in a cover-up, thereby enabling VW to utilize the stolen trade secrets," Edmunds wrote. Reacting to the ruling, GM said in a statement that Edmunds' order meant its most serious allegations would be presented in open court with witnesses under oath. "It also means that we are yet another step closer to a remedy for the substantial damages we suffered when Lopez was lured away from GM and defected to VW with our trade secrets," GM spokesman John Mueller said. A spokesman for VW's North American subsidiary could not immediately be reached for comment. Edmunds' order marked the second time in a month that she has issued an unfavourable ruling against VW. In October, she denied a VW motion to dismiss the case in U.S. federal court. She also ruled that Piech and several other top VW officials should remain defendants in GM's civil complaint.
83167>>0>> Pressure is mounting on Volkswagen AG to settle a U.S. lawsuit alleging it stole secrets from a rival since observers say the carmaker could face several hundred million dollars in damages if the case goes to trial. Media reports in recent days have said VW has held secret talks with General Motors Corp aimed at settling the civil lawsuit that GM filed last March alleging some VW officials took the secret documents when they left the company. Both German-based Volkswagen and Opel, the German unit of General Motors, have declined comment on the reports. But industry sources in Germany said the threat of a judgement against VW in the U.S. civil lawsuit is rising and has prompted more talks between the two companies. "The situation for VW is so threatening that they are trying to demonstrate to their shareholders that they are seeking to limit the damages," said one source who asked not to be identified. Contact between the two carmakers -- including a reported meeting in Detroit between VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen and GM executive committeee chairman John Smale -- may lead to a deal in the coming weeks to months, the sources said. One factor pushing VW to settle the suit is an expected ruling in the coming days by a U.S. judge in Detroit on whether GM can pursue racketeering charges that were first used to fight the mafia and have since been expanded to business cases. Approval for GM to pursue the RICO law, or the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act, could force VW to pay triple damages if found guilty by a U.S. jury -- and could lead to a payout in the billions of dollars, sources said. Guidelines for any settlement are expected to at least follow the demands Opel made in August 1993 -- a public apology, the resignation of VW executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and a substantial payout for damages to the carmaker. Lopez, a Spaniard, and three other former GM executives now at VW, are under investigation in Germany and the U.S. for stealing secret data when they left Opel for GM in March 1993. Lopez and the others joined Volkswagen after it reported a massive one billion mark loss and then implemented innovative production practices that have since led to hefty profits.

Under U.S. law, criminal indictments can be filed against both a corporation and also the responsible individual members of that company's management. VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech, who is named as a defendant along with some other top VW executives in the U.S. civil court lawsuit, has said publically that he would stand by Lopez even if he faced the criminal charges. But Germany's Spiegel said in a report this week that VW has offered to terminate Lopez's contract as part of a deal with Opel. In any case, the magazine said VW's supervisory board has demanded that Lopez leave the company.

83167>>0>> The recently retired head of Britain's MI5 security service, Stella Rimington, is to join the board of Marks and Spencer, the British department store group said on Wednesday. Rimington's appointment as a non-executive director takes her from the undercover world of espionage to a retailing group whose range spans food to underwear. She ran MI5 for four years until last April, a period that coincided with unprecedented official openness about the internal security agency after the end of the Cold War. As well as being the first woman to head MI5, where she had earlier been a deputy director-general, Rimington was also the first spy chief to be named publicly by the government. Until then, it had been an offence under the Official Secrets Act to publish the name of the "DG" responsible for counter-espionage and stamping out subversion.

83167>>0>> German shares were expected to experience a period of stable trade in the near-term after Tuesday's record high levels, dealers said. They said afternoon dealings were being slightly pressured by early losses on Wall Street, but said the effect was only short term and the DAX index of 30 top shares should not suffer too much. The IBIS DAX index was down 14.77 points, or 0.53 percent, at 2,793.82 points shortly before the close of trade, losing ground after the Dow Jones started weaker and German bonds lost most of their sheen.   The DAX touched a day low of 2,786.61 points after U.S. durable goods data came in stronger than expected, reviving some inflation worries and causing German bonds to erase strong gains made earlier in the day. But dealers said that the upward trend in the DAX was still intact and that a slight correction was perfectly healthy for the market. Dealers said the day's main focus had been shares in Volkswagen AG, which ended computer dealings down five percent, or 32.50 marks at 608 marks, after a U.S. judge denied VW's motion to dismiss racketeering claims by rival Opel.   The ruling could open VW to potentially higher damages in the lawsuit with Opel, a subsidiary of U.S. carmaker General Motors. VW shares were also under pressure after the firm said it could introduce short-time working hours at its main plant because a French truck blockade has hit the supply of car parts. Dealers said VW's lossed had weighed on the whole market and on other shares in the car sector in particular. BMW AG ended IBIS dealings down 8.60 marks at 972.50 marks and Daimler-Benz AG was 1.15 marks off at 98.60 marks.   Meanwhile, shares in airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG ended down 28 pfennigs at 19.90 marks. The company is due to report nine month figures on Thursday. Late on Wednesday the German trade union involved in a pay dispute with Lufthansa said it could not rule out further stoppages. Dealers said trade volume was likely to be thinner than normal on Thursday, with the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S.. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Accused CIA double-agent Harold Nicholson pleaded innocent on Wednesday to charges of conspiracy to spy for Russia and a judge set March 10 as a trial date. Judge James Cacheris also said he was imposing a gag order on lawyers for both sides and on officials of the Justice Department and the Central Intelligence Agency in the case of Nicholson, a former CIA station chief who was arrested on Nov. 16. He is being held without bond pending trial.   Nicholson waived his right to a jury trial within 70 days. The slight delay gives his lawyers more time to obtain security clearances they need to review much of the government's evidence. Asked how Nicholson, the highest-ranking CIA official ever charged with espionage, would plead, defence lawyer Jonathan Shapiro said, "not guilty." Nicholson, 46, was asked by the judge if he understood that he was giving up his rights under a federal speedy-trial law. "Yes I do, your honour," he replied in a strong voice. A one-count indictment handed up by a federal grand jury last week accused him of taking more than $180,000 for spying for Moscow from June 1994 until his arrest. During that time he allegedly handed over classified documents and unmasked undercover CIA officers.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen on Wednesday rejected a demand by rival carmaker Opel, the German unit of U.S. car giant General Motors, that a top VW executive at the centre of industrial espionage charges be sacked. Opel said the man, production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, would have to be dismissed before it would consider an out-of-court settlement of the dispute. But a VW spokesman rejected the demand as being unacceptable and said any talks over a deal in the U.S. lawsuit filed by Opel and General Motors against Volkswagen would require no preconditions. Opel's demand that Lopez be fired came after a U.S. judge in Detroit, the hometown of GM, decided to allow the carmaker to pursue racketeering charges against the executive and other VW bosses, including management board chairman Ferdinand Piech. "There will be no dismissal of Mr. Lopez," VW spokesman Klaus Kocks told Reuters. He added, "Where there is no damage, there can be no compensation." The U.S. court decision pushed shares in VW -- Europe's largest carmaker -- down almost six percent on Wednesday. VW shares ended the bourse session at 601.25 marks. They had closed on Tuesday at 639 marks. Opel dismissed speculation that it was already in talks with VW to reach a deal on the lawsuit. It not only demanded that Lopez go before relations could be improved, but also reiterated other demands first laid out in August 1993 after Lopez left GM for VW. These include a public apology by top VW executives and an unspecified payment for damages. "Rather than take these necessary steps, Volkswagen management has continued to deny any wrongdoing and has supported Lopez by retaining him as a senior member of management," the Ruesselsheim-based carmaker said. Opel made the announcement after Germany's Spiegel magazine at the weekend said the carmakers were in talks to settle the lawsuit linked to Lopez and other former Opel executives now at VW, who allegedly stole secret documents before they left. Spiegel said VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen and GM executive committeee chairman John Smale had recently met in Detroit to consider a possible out-of-court settlement. Opel said it was not its policy to comment on the status of confidential talks but felt obliged "to correct misleading information that has been disseminated to the public". "There are currently no settlement negotiations in progress between Opel and General Motors and Volkswagen," Opel said. Mounting speculation about a deal comes after GM and Opel have racked up a series of courtroom victories in recent weeks against VW and Lopez and strong comments from management at both carmakers about their willingness to pursue VW and Lopez. Lopez's lawyer has said he expected German prosecutors to soon file criminal charges against his client, another black eye for VW as it seeks to maintain profits in a difficult European automobile market. In addition, a U.S. grand jury in Detroit will soon have the chance to review documents from the German investigation after a Frankfurt court approved last Friday the transfer of the documents to the U.S. Justice Department and the FBI. Volkswagen downplayed the impact of the Detroit ruling. "This has nothing to do with the merits of the allegations, but merely whether they are legally sufficient, being taken as true, to state a claim," VW quoted its U.S. lawyer, Jim Denvir. U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds said in a written order that GM's complaint alleging that VW stole confidential documents adequately met the standard needed to proceed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO). If a jury finds VW damaged GM, VW could be forced to pay out triple the amount of damages, according to the RICO law. The statute, which has been widely used to prosecute the mafia in the U.S., requires proof of an ongoing conspiracy or enterprise that aims to commit fraud or other criminal acts. Under the RICO law, GM claimed that Lopez, VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech and other executives were in a conspiracy to steal important documents on strategy, pricing and manufacturing techniques and transport them to Germany.
83167>>0>> Shares in Volkswagen AG -- Europe's largest carmaker -- extended losses on Wednesday, falling almost six percent after a U.S. judge on Tuesday denied VW's attempt to dismiss racketeering claims by rival Opel AG. The ruling could open VW to potentially higher damages in a lawsuit with Opel, the German unit of U.S. carmaker General Motors Corp, over alleged industrial espionage. VW shares fell as much as 38 marks to 601 marks before recovering slightly to trade at 604.50 marks at midday. Dealers did not want to talk of an accelerating sell-off since trading volumes were not high enough. Analysts at Dresdner Bank said a drop in VW shares to 600 marks should be used as an opportunity to buy the stock, which first topped the 600 mark level on October 30. The broader German share market was slightly weaker, with the 30-share DAX index of German shares, which includes VW, down 0.45 percent at 2,797.90 points. In addition, VW shares were under pressure after VW said it would decide on Monday whether to introduce short-time working hours at its main plant in Wolfsburg because the supply of car parts has been affected by a French trucker strike. But traders said the threat of hefty damages in the U.S. lawsuit filed by Opel and parent company General Motors was the primary reason for the stocks's drop. In New York, GM shares closed up $1/8 at $58-3/8 in an overall weaker market after the news. Dealers emphasised the fact that VW shares reached a year high of 645 marks in computer dealings on Tuesday and said the current fall could in part be put down to the share price correcting after its recent rally. VW shares have been one a one-way upward path, gaining almost 30 percent, since late July when the stock was at a low of 498 marks. Analysts said that although damages could be more than expected, VW should not suffer too much. "I don't see VW's image being hit by any verdict. They will keep doing what they are doing," said Peter Schmidt, analyst at Automotive Industry Data in Britain. "It could potentially be damaging but it should blow over and the public really doesn't care because it doesn't affect how a VW performs on the road," Schmidt added. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> German carmaker Volkswagen AG on Wednesday rejected a demand by rival Adam Opel AG that a top VW executive at the centre of a legal fight be sacked before any talk of a potential settlement. A VW spokesman rejected the demand as being unacceptable and said any talks over an out-of-court settlement in the U.S. lawsuit filed by Opel and parent company General Motors Corp against Volkswagen would require no preconditions. Opel earlier on Wednesday demanded that VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who left GM in 1993 to join VW, be fired before any talks could begin. Opel also denied published reports that talks have already taken place. The call for Lopez to be fired also came after a U.S. judge in Detroit, the hometown of GM, decided on Tuesday to allow the carmaker to pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and other VW bosses, including management board chairman Ferdinand Piech. "There will be no dismissal of Mr. Lopez," VW spokesman Klaus Kocks told Reuters. He added, "Where there is no damage, there can be no compensation." VW's supervisory board is scheduled to meet on Friday but company officials have said Lopez's future with the company was not expected to be a topic. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

Opel, dismissing speculation that it was currently in talks with VW to reach a deal on a U.S. civil court lawsuit, said Lopez must go before any hint of improving relations. Other demands from Opel, first laid out in August 1993 after Lopez left GM in March 1993 for VW, must include a public apology by top VW executives and an unspecified payment for damages, Opel reiterated. "Volkswagen management has not acceded to these fundamental and equitable bases for an honorable and fair resolution of this matter," Opel said in a statement. "Rather than take these necessary steps, Volkswagen management has continued to deny any wrongdoing and has supported Lopez by retaining him as a senior member of management," the Ruesselsheim-based carmaker said.

Under the RICO law, GM claimed that Lopez, VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech and other executives were in a conspiracy to steal documents and transport them to Germany. GM, in the the civil court lawsuit filed last March, claims the documents included information on future product plans, parts prices and manufacturing techniques and unfairly allowed VW to reduce its costs, causing GM to suffer hefty damages.

Opel said production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua would have to be dismissed before it would consider an out-of-court settlement of the dispute.

83167>>0>> German carmaker Opel AG on Wednesday said it was not at the moment in talks with rival Volkswagen AG to reach an out-of-court deal on a U.S. civil court lawsuit Opel has filed against the carmaker alleging it had stolen industrial secrets. "There are at the moment no settlement discussions between Opel (and parent company General Motors Corp) and Volkswagen," Opel said in a statement. Opel made the announcement after Germany's Spiegel magazine said at the weekend that the carmakers were in secret talks to settle the lawsuit linked to the transfer of former GM production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua in March 1993 to Volkswagen. The carmaker said it was not its policy to comment on the status of confidential settlement negotiations but said it felt required to do so "to correct misleading information that has been disseminated to the public, as in this case". A Volkswagen spokesman was not immediately available for comment but a company official said a news statement was expected to be released on Wednesday. GM won a major court victory on Tuesday when a U.S. judge in Detroit allowed the carmaker to pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and some top VW executives, including VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech, over the documents. Opel reaffirmed that any talks on a deal to settle the lawsuit would require Lopez to be fired from VW, payment for damages and a public explanation and apology. "Volkswagen management has not acceded to these fundamental and equitable bases for an honorable and fair resolution of this matter," Opel said. "Rather than take these necessary steps, Volkswagen management has continued to deny any wrongdoing and has supported Lopez by retaining him as a senior member of management," Opel said in the statement. GM and Opel said in the statement that they would keep up their legal fight against Volkswagen in both the United States and Germany and would cooperate with prosecutors who are reviewing criminal charges against VW and Lopez. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

83167>>0>> Shares in German carmaker Volkswagen AG tumbled about five percent in active pre-bourse IBIS dealings on Wednesday after a U.S. judge denied VW's motion to dismiss racketeering claims by rival Opel. VW shares fell as much as 33.30 marks ($21.83) to 607.20 marks before trading at 0830 GMT down 29 marks at 611.50 marks. Meanwhile the rest of the market was slightly weaker, the DAX index of leading shares, which includes VW, down 0.28 percent at 2,800.74 points. The U.S. ruling could open VW to potentially higher damages in a jury trial verdict since the U.S. racketeering law approved by the judge calls for damages to be tripled. In addition, VW shares were under pressure after VW said it would decide on Monday whether to introduce short-time working hours at its main plant in Wolfsburg because the supply of car parts has been affected by a French trucker strike. But traders said the threat of hefty damages in the U.S. lawsuit filed by Opel and parent company General Motors Corp was the primary reason for the stock's drop. In New York, GM shares closed up $1/8 at $58-3/8 in an overall weaker market. The U.S. lawsuit centres on Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a former GM production executive who abruptly quit to join VW in 1993 and is under investigation in the U.S. and Germany for allegedly taking along secret documents. Other top VW executives, including VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech, are named as defendants in the suit. GM claims the stolen documents, which included information on future product plans, parts prices and manufacturing techniques, unfairly allowed VW to reduce its costs, causing GM unspecified financial damage. Under the racketeering law, known as RICO, GM has claimed that Volkswagen, Lopez and other top executives participated in a conspiracy to steal documents and transport them to Germany. In addition to the civil lawsuit, Lopez's lawyer said he expected German prosecutors to file criminal charges against his client by the end of November. A U.S. grand jury is also investigating Lopez and a Frankfurt appellate court last Friday approved sending documents from the German probe to U.S. prosecutors. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525 ($ = 1.525 German Marks)
83167>>0>> A Volkswagen AG supervisory board member said late on Tuesday he did not expect a decision to be made at a meeting this week on the future of a manager at the centre of a legal fight with rival Opel AG. Klaus Zwickel, who is also chairman of Germany's IG Metall union, said it was unlikely that a decision would be made by the board about Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. Lopez is under investigation in the U.S. and Germany for allegedly taking along secret documents when he abruptly left Opel, a unit of General Motors Corp, in 1993 and joined the management board of VW in charge of production. VW's supervisory board is scheduled to meet on Friday. Zwickel also said he was unaware of any secret talks between VW and GM to reach an out-of-court settlement on a U.S. civil lawsuit filed by GM against the Wolfsburg-based carmaker. Industry sources say VW is under pressure to settle the lawsuit after a U.S. federal judge on Tuesday denied Volkswagen AG's motion to dismiss racketeering claims by GM, opening VW to potentially higher damages in a jury trial verdict. GM claims the stolen documents, which included information on future product plans, parts prices and manufacturing techniques, unfairly allowed VW to reduce its costs, causing GM unspecified financial damage.

83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua is likely to resign Friday over a three-year industrial espionage battle with General Motors Corp., sources close to VW said Thursday. Lopez, 55, accused by GM of stealing secret documents when he defected to VW from the U.S. car giant in 1993, is likely to offer his resignation at a supervisory board meeting, the sources told Reuters. VW, which has come under mounting pressure in recent weeks to reach an out-of-court settlement with GM, declined to comment on the matter. "To spare you the frustrating telephone calls, here is the following advisory: no (repeat no) statement is to be expected from us today," VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said in a news release distributed Thursday in response to a report in Handelsblatt newspaper that Lopez was likely to resign. VW's supervisory board was scheduled to meet Friday at 0800 GMT (3 a.m. EST). The board's central committee, made up of IG Metall union Chairman Klaus Zwickel, works council Chairman Klaus Volkert, Lower Saxony Premier Gerhard Schroeder and supervisory board Chairman Klaus Liesen, was due to meet on Thursday afternoon. VW on Wednesday rejected a demand by Opel that it should sack Lopez, apologise, and offer compensation in return for an out-of-court settlement in a U.S. civil lawsuit filed by Opel and GM earlier this year. Handelsblatt, citing "well-informed" sources, said VW's supervisory board would not dishonourably dismiss Lopez. Both VW and Opel have officially denied media reports that they have been negotiating an out-of-court settlement, but sources close to GM said VW supervisory board Chairman Liesen has made contact with GM over the matter. The sources said GM did not expect VW Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech to back down but expected some movement from VW's supervisory board. GM alleges that Lopez and three other former GM executives now at VW stole secret documents on purchasing and car production plans when they moved to VW. VW has consistently denied the accusations and given Lopez its full backing. But pressure on the carmaker has mounted after several adverse court decisions over recent weeks. On Tuesday a U.S. district judge in Detroit, GM's home town, ruled GM could pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and other VW executives, including Piech. Allowing the racketeering charges trebles the amount of compensation VW would have to pay if found guilty. Industry sources say VW may have to pay billions of dollars. VW suffered another blow last week when a Frankfurt court ruled that lawyers representing Lopez would have to hand over key documents at the request of the U.S. authorities. And Lopez' own lawyers have said they expect German prosecutors to file criminal charges of industrial spying in a German court by the end of November. VW's shares, which fell almost 6 percent Wednesday after news of the U.S. court's decision to allow racketeering charges, rose 2.3 percent or 13.75 marks ($8.98) to close at 615 marks ($401.57) Thursday amid hopes the carmakers will reach a deal. Dealers said hopes that Lopez' departure could defuse the dispute with GM far outweighed worries about the loss of him as a manager. Lopez, a Spaniard, joined Volkswagen after it reported a massive one billion mark ($650 million) loss and then implemented innovative production practices that have since led to hefty profits. GM has alleged that secret production plans for its "Plant X" were used by VW to build a new plant in Brazil. Other documents related to purchasing contracts were also allegedly stolen by Lopez and the other former GM employees now at VW.

83167>>0>> German shares powered ahead to new record highs on Thursday, boosted by strength in the German bond market and a firmer dollar, which helped shares in stocks of many German exporters climb to new ground. Even the lack of the U.S. market, which often provides direction for the German market but which was closed for the Thanksgiving holiday, could not dampen the rally. The DAX index of 30 top shares ended bourse trade on Thursday at a record closing high of 2,817.49 points, up 0.73 percent, or 20.46 points, after the dollar raced up to its highest level for a month against the mark. The dollar penetrated the crucial 1.53 mark level after the Bank of France monetary policy council member Jean-Pierre Gerard said he favoured a stronger dollar against the mark. Later, in the last half hour of post-bourse electronic dealings, the IBIS DAX lept ahead even further, ending at 2,829.68 points, up 1.28 percent, or 35.82 points, earlier making a record of 2,832.30 points. The late surge came after the December German Bund future made a new all-time high. The strength in the dollar meant that much of the day's rally was led by shares in the export-oriented autos and chemicals sectors. Most of the major German chemical companies charged ahead, with shares in BASF AG gaining most to end computer trade up almost three percent at 56.10 marks. Meanwhile in the car sector, the biggest gainer was BMW, also gaining almost three percent and mounting the 1,000 mark level for the first time ever to end up 27.60 marks at 1000.10 marks. Shares in Europe's largest carmaker Volkswagen continued to be at the centre of attention and recovered some ground, closing IBIS dealings up six marks at 614 marks. The stock had fallen six percent on Wednesday after a U.S. court ruling that could open VW to potentially much higher damages in a lawsuit with Opel, a subsidiary of U.S. carmaker General Motors. On Thursday, sources close to the company said production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, at the centre of alleged industrial espionage charges, was likely to offer his resignation on Friday.  REUTER
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua is likely to resign on Friday over a three-year industrial espionage battle with General Motors, sources close to VW said on Thursday. Lopez, 55, accused by GM of stealing secret documents when he defected to VW from the U.S. car giant in 1993, is likely to offer his resignation at a supervisory board meeting, the sources told Reuters. VW, which has come under mounting pressure in recent weeks to reach an out-of-court settlement with GM, declined to comment on the matter. "To spare you the frustrating telephone calls, here is the following advisory: no (repeat no) statement is to be expected from us today," VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said in a news release distributed on Thursday in response to a report in Handelsblatt newspaper that Lopez was likely to resign. VW's supervisory board was scheduled to meet on Friday at 0800 GMT. The board's central committee, made up of IG Metall union chairman Klaus Zwickel, works council chairman Klaus Volkert, Lower Saxony premier Gerhard Schroeder and supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen, was due to meet on Thursday afternoon. VW on Wednesday rejected a demand by Opel that it should sack Lopez, apologise, and offer compensation in return for an out-of-court settlement in a U.S. civil lawsuit filed by Opel and GM earlier this year. Handelsblatt, citing "well-informed" sources, said VW's supervisory board would not dishonourably dismiss Lopez. Both VW and Opel have officially denied media reports that they have been negotiating an out-of-court settlement, but sources close to GM said VW supervisory board chairman Liesen has made contact with GM over the matter. The sources said GM did not expect VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech to back down but expected some movement from VW's supervisory board. GM alleges that Lopez and three other former GM executives now at VW stole secret documents on purchasing and car production plans when they moved to VW. VW has consistently denied the accusations and given Lopez its full backing. But pressure on the carmaker has mounted after several adverse court decisions over recent weeks. On Tuesday a U.S. district judge in Detroit, GM's home town, ruled GM could pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and other VW executives, including Piech. Allowing the racketeering charges trebles the amount of compensation VW would have to pay if found guilty. Industry sources say VW may have to pay billions of dollars. VW suffered another blow last week when a Frankfurt court ruled that lawyers representing Lopez would have to hand over key documents at the request of the U.S. authorities. And Lopez' own lawyers have said they expect German prosecutors to file criminal charges of industrial spying in a German court by the end of November. VW's shares, which fell almost six percent on Wednesday after news of the U.S. court's decision to allow racketeering charges, rose 2.3 percent or 13.75 marks to close at 615 marks on Thursday amid hopes the carmakers will reach a deal. Dealers said hopes that Lopez' departure could defuse the dispute with GM far outweighed worries about the loss of him as a manager. Lopez, a Spaniard, joined Volkswagen after it reported a one billion mark ($650 million) loss and then implemented innovative production practices that have since led to hefty profits. GM has alleged that secret production plans for its "Plant X" were used by VW to build a new plant in Brazil. Other documents related to purchasing contracts were also allegedly stolen by Lopez and the other former GM employees now at VW.
83167>>0>> Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, expected to resign from his post as production chief at Volkswagen AG on Friday after accusations he stole trade ideas, won recognition as a cost-cutting crusader. His talents earned him the nickname of "Superlopez" but his reputation has been tainted by accusations that he took industrial secrets on purchasing and car production when he defected to VW from General Motors in early 1993. The accusations, consistently denied by VW and steadfastly upheld by GM and its German subsidiary Adam Opel AG throughout a three-year legal battle, look set to prompt his resignation at a supervisory board meeting on Friday, sources close to VW said. VW, which largely owes its return to profitabilty to Lopez, declined to comment, but pressure on the carmaker has mounted following a series of adverse court decisions in recent weeks. The flood of accusations has not dimmed the strong feelings of support the 16,000 people of Amorebieta hold for its most famous son, who himself has always denied the charges. In the grim industrial town where he grew up, his friends remember a side of Lopez that eludes those more familiar with his image as one of the world's most merciless cost-cutters. "Goodness is the word that best describes him. He is a person who radiates tranquility and confidence," said a friend from his engineering school days. "Our village follows the news about the accusations against Jose Ignacio with a lot of interest, but we are confident that it will be resolved," said boyhood friend Jaime Fernandez Amar. Lopez, married to a Basque woman for 27 years, continues to visit the town and his mother, who lives in a modest flat. For the townspeople he remains the honest, God-fearing, patriotic Basque they watched grow to manhood. "Not only did we study together," said the friend from Bilbao engineering college, where Lopez studied from 1959 to 1966, "we also participated in Catholic organisations, and as much for me as for him religious convictions and morality continue to play an important role." Many count on Lopez's love of his homeland and his know-how to help revive his town's industrial aspirations and save it from becoming a bedroom community for nearby Bilbao. They hope he will help set up a car factory here. "This is a man of his town, a hard worker who has always achieved what he wanted," said a local journalist. But, Volkswagen discarded initial plans to build a factory in Amorebieta in 1993. A second project, to open a truck plant, also failed to materialise when VW opted for Brazil. However, the provincial government of Vizcaya says talks with the German automaker have been reopened and it has reserved one million square metres of land should they end well. A few young people showed a touch of scepticism. "One thing is what they say and another is what they do," said a young barman and neighbour of Lopez's mother. But for many his character remains unquestioned. "Knowing him, I can vouch that he has never done anything against his conscience," said the journalist. "Everything they said he robbed he did not need to take because he had it in his head. They were his own ideas."
83167>>0>> German carmaker Volkswagen AG's share price has suffered lately, hurt by the row between VW and GM 's Adam Opel, but analysts say it could gain new life if production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arritortua resigns. Sources close to VW said on Thursday that Lopez was likely to resign on Friday. Lopez is the key figure in a three-year legal battle with General Motors over allegations of industrial espionage. Ironically, news that the feted cost-cutter was leaving VW boosted its shares by almost two percent on Thursday. Dealers said hopes that his departure could defuse the dispute with GM far outweighed worries about the loss of Lopez as a manager. "This looks like it could be the first step towards a proper settlement and I think the market would react positively were Lopez to step down," said Timo Graucob, motor industry analyst at Hypo Bank in Munich. Josh Waiblinger, of BHF Bank's Institutional Investor department, said: "If Lopez leaves, then the measures he has introduced will stay behind him. His resignation would be positive for the share price -- I think the current negotiations are all about saving face." "If there wasn't such a huge amount of investors' money being destroyed on the markets because of this row, then I would describe the whole thing as a farce," said Waiblinger. Volkswagen shares have had a good run over the last four years. In January 1992 the share stood at around 300 marks, falling below 300 marks in January 1993 when the company reported operating losses of 1.636 billion marks ($1.07 billion) and the legal row first reared its head. Since then the share price has risen strongly despite a dip in July of this year to 498 marks, when the U.S. aspect of the legal battle surfaced. However, news from the U.S. on Tuesday that VW could be open to potentially higher damages on charges of racketeering saw the stock fall nearly six percent to 601 marks. The share recovered thereafter as rumours of a settlement grew. VW shares closed bourse trade at 613 marks on Thursday, up 11.75 marks, but still well off a year high of 642.50 marks. "I can definitely imagine that Lopez will step down and I think that would be a good solution for the company and that we could then see an out-of-court agreeement," said Graucob. But patience is not limitless on the floor of the Frankfurt bourse, where traders are getting impatient. "We don't want this to go on too long. If they don't get an agreement soon, the share could go below 600 marks, maybe down to 575 marks," said one trader. Recent days have seen huge chunks of Volkswagen market capitalisation destroyed as market players seek to quantify the damage that could be done to Volkswagen if the U.S. court sides with Opel on the racketeering charge. Analysts and traders alike are loath to put a number on the amount that VW would have to pay in an out-of-court settlement, but the figures are generally in the billions of marks. If the company loses its court case, the figure could triple. "If you look at what has happened to the share this week -- 1.4 billion marks in market cap was wiped out yesterday -- then I think you could say that 60 or 70 percent of a potential payout has been discounted," said Waiblinger. Graucob said: "The case has already taken three years to get to trial, and the trial will run and run and no-one but the lawyers is going to get rich on the back of a case like this." "Two years ago it would have been a disaster. He's a very competent manager and it is a pity to change a top manager out of the team, but if he stays it could ultimately damage the company," said Graucob. ($1=1.5330 Mark)
83167>>0>> Germany's DAX index of 30 top shares ended bourse trade on Thursday at a record closing high, after the dollar raced up to its highest level for a month against the mark, boosting German exporting stocks. The DAX index closed at 2,817.49 points, up 0.73 percent, or 20.46 points, just below its all-time intraday record high of 2,819.95 points reached on Tuesday. The dollar penetrated the crucial 1.53 mark level, after the Bank of France monetary policy council member Jean-Pierre Gerard said he favoured a stronger dollar against the mark, particularly benefiting Germany's export-oriented chemicals and auto sectors. But dealers said volumes were somewhat dampened due to the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S.. Shares in Europe's biggest carmaker Volkswagen AG continued to be at the centre of attention and recovered two percent, closing bourse dealings up 11.70 marks at 613 marks. The stock had fallen six percent on Wednesday after a U.S. judge ruling that could open VW to potentially much higher damages in a lawsuit with Opel, a subsidiary of U.S. carmaker General Motors. On Thursday, sources close to the company said production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, at the centre of alleged industrial espionage charges, was likely to offer his resignation on Friday. Opel has demanded that VW should sack Lopez, apologise, and offer compensation in return for an out-of-court settlement in a U.S. civil lawsuit filed by Opel and GM earlier this year. Dealers said if no settlement was reached in the next few days then VW shares could slip below the 600 mark level. Meanwhile, shares in national airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG ended up 12 pfennigs at 19.87 marks. The shares had temporarily dipped after the company reported a decline in pre-tax profits for the first nine months of the year, but later recovered.

83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG's (VW) production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua is likely to offer his resignation on Friday, the German business daily Handelsblatt reported on Thursday. Lopez is at the centre of a three-year legal battle between VW and General Motors (GM) unit Opel, which accuses him of taking company secrets when he moved to VW from GM in 1993. On Wednesday, VW rejected a demand by Opel that Lopez be sacked before it would consider an out-of-court settlement. Handelsblatt quoted well-informed sources as saying he would offer VW's supervisory board his resignation on Friday, but the board would not dishonourably dismiss Lopez. No one at VW was immediately available for comment. VW's supervisory board is scheduled to meet on Friday. The central committee of the board meets on Thursday. Opel's demand that Lopez be fired came after a U.S. judge in Detroit, GM's home, decided GM could pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and other VW executives, including board chairman Ferdinand Piech. If a jury finds VW harmed GM, the German car giant could be fined triple the amount of the damage found to have been caused. The U.S. court ruling pushed shares in VW, Europe's largest carmaker, down almost six percent on Wednesday to 601.25 marks from Tuesday's close of 639 marks. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG said it would not comment on Thursday on a report in the Handelsblatt newspaper that its production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua was likely to offer his resignation. VW said in a brief statement it was being overwhelmed by calls from the media about the impact on VW of the French truckers' strike and the report in the Handeslblatt. "To spare you the frustrating telephone calls, here is the following advisory: no (repeat no) statement is to be expected from us today," VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said in the statement.   "I know that is not going to make you very happy. Until tomorrow!" Handelsblatt quoted "well-informed" sources as saying Lopez, at the centre of a three-year legal battle with General Motors over alleged industrial espionage, would offer VW's supervisory board his resignation on Friday. VW's supervisory board is scheduled to meet on Friday. The central committee of the board meets on Thursday. -- Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Shares in German car-maker Volkswagen AG edged higher in pre-bourse trade on Thursday after a newspaper report that its production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua was likely to offer his resignation. Lopez is at the centre of a three-year legal battle between VW and General Motors (GM) unit Opel, which accuses him of taking company secrets with him when he moved to VW from GM in 1993. In pre-bourse electronic trade, VW shares gained 5.50 marks to 613.50. Its stock fell 37.75 marks in bourse trade on Wednesday after a U.S. judge decided to allow GM to pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and other VW bosses, including management board chairman Ferdinand Piech. VW said in a statement that it would not be commenting Thursday on the report of Lopez's imminent resignation, which appeared in the Handeslblatt German business daily. If a jury finds VW harmed GM, VW could be forced to pay triple the amount of the damage found to have been caused. -- Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525

83167>>0>> German shares received an early boost on Thursday when the dollar raced up to its highest level for a month against the mark, boosting German exporting stocks in particular. The DAX index of 30 leading shares touched a day's high of 2,816.63 points in early trade, just below its all-time record high of 2,819.95 points, before paring gains slightly to stand up 16.43 points, or 0.59 percent at 2,813.46 by 1024 GMT. The dollar penetrated the crucial 1.53 mark level, after the Bank of France monetary policy council member Jean-Pierre Gerard said he wanted a stronger dollar against the mark. Before the dollar rally, dealers had been expecting the DAX to take a breather before making a fresh assault on its record highs, with business likely to be dampened by Thanksgiving holiday in U.S. They said the effect was likely to be particularly noticable in the afternoon, when the German market could miss inspiration from the U.S. markets. Meanwhile shares in Europe's biggest carmaker Volkswagen AG recovered slightly after a newspaper report that its production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua was likely to offer his resignation. Sources close to the company said he was expected to resign from his post on Friday. Lopez is at the centre of a VW legal battle with Opel, a unit of U.S. giant General Motors, over alleged industrial espionage charges. VW shares recovered 14.20 marks to 615.50 marks in bourse trade, after slipping six percent on Wednesday on worries that VW may face bigger damages than previously expected. But dealers said if no settlement was reached in the next few days then VW shares could slip below the 600 mark level. One dealer said that if Lopez resigned, that could be taken by the market as an admission of guilt and could also damage the stock. Meanwhile shares in national airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG gained over one percent, climbing 20 pfennigs to 19.95 marks, after reporting a decline in pre-tax profits for the first nine months of the year, but predicting an improvement next year.

83167>>0>> General Motors Corp. released a three sentence statement Friday calling the resignation of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua from Volkswagen AG "long overdue." "The resignation of VW management board member Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua is a long overdue first step that has been needlessly delayed for more than three years," GM spokesman John Mueller said in a prepared statement. "It is now time for Volkswagen management to address the real issues in this matter in a responsible manner rather than continue to create irrelevant side issues," Mueller said. "The harm caused to GM and Opel by the wrongful conduct of Lopez and his collaborators remains to be remedied," Mueller said in the statement. GM officials declined to comment on whether the two sides are involved in settlement talks. Lopez, the former purchasing head of GM who defected to Volkswagen in 1993, is at the centre of international espionage charges filed by GM. Lopez resigned from Volkswagen Friday, saying he needs to concentrate on his legal defence as well as start his own consulting firm.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG, cornered by adverse court rulings in its three-year legal fight with General Motors Corp., on Friday sacrificed its production chief in an apparent bid to end the dispute. Three days after a court ruling stepped up pressure on VW, the company's supervisory board accepted the resignation of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the production official accused by GM of stealing documents when he and several others left GM to join Europe's largest automaker in 1993. Lawyers for Lopez said he had asked to resign to concentrate on his defense and to start his own consulting firm. VW praised the 55-year-old Lopez and continued to maintain that he did not steal industrial secrets from GM or its German subsidiary Adam Opel AG. While officials on both sides were tight-lipped, speculation swirled that the companies planned further talks to try to settle the dispute, which could end up costing VW billions of dollars if it loses in court. "Investigations by independent auditors have given no indications that Opel secrets were passed on to VW, and no indications that Lopez colluded with VW employees to transfer secrets," VW supervisory board Chairman Klaus Liesen told a news conference. "No one can claim VW has acted improperly," Liesen said. GM and its Opel unit said Lopez's resignation was long overdue and was not sufficient to settle the case. "The resignation of Lopez is three years overdue and cannot compensate our company for the losses incurred to date," Opel said in a statement. Pressure on VW to settle the case rose on Tuesday after a U.S. District Judge in Detroit, GM's home town, ruled that the world's largest automaker could pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and other VW executives, including VW Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech. Allowing the case to proceed under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), which has been widely used to prosecute the Mafia, triples the amount of money VW would have to pay if found guilty. Industry sources said that could amount to billions of dollars. One U.S. auto industry expert said he believed GM's senior executives want adequate compensation from VW on their civil claims in the United States, but would ultimately prefer to not put their company through a bitter trial, which would create a side show and distract from its primary business. "I don't think they want the auto business to turn into an international soap opera, and that's what would happen," said David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Center for the Study of Automotive Transportation in Ann Arbor, Mich. "It's not one of those things that's good for anybody. Now that Lopez is gone, Cole said he believed there will be some other public actions taken, such as an apology from VW. "They would like to have this thing disappear, but they would like to have the world know that VW did something wrong." he said. In its civil lawsuit filed in March, GM alleged that Lopez and several associates stole confidential documents when they left for the German automaker. VW has consistently denied accusations that Lopez and other former GM executives now at VW stole boxes of secret documents and computer disks on purchasing and car production plans when they defected to VW in early 1993. GM officials declined to comment on whether the two sides were holding settlement talks. VW's Piech said the two companies had discussed a settlement in three rounds of talks without conditions, and that VW would not bend to any conditions now. While Lopez' resignation fulfilled a key demand by GM and Opel, the companies have also asked for financial compensation and a public apology. A source at Opel said Friday that recent talks between the two sides went nowhere because GM and Opel officials felt VW's offer was not in the ballpark. A former GM manager who joined VW with Lopez will also resign, Piech told reporters, adding he hoped Lopez would continue to work for VW as a consultant. In a statement on Friday, VW's supervisory board thanked Lopez for his "excellent" work. A Basque known for his ability to streamline production and cut costs, Lopez established innovative working practices at VW that helped return it to profitability. Liesen said VW would meet its commitments under Lopez' contract, which was due to expire in March 1998. He did not elaborate.
83167>>0>> The dispute over Volkswagen's hiring of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua from General Motors has been going on for nearly four years now. Lopez, whose resignation was accepted by Volkswagen on Friday, has been at the centre of a three-year legal battle between VW and General Motors. Following are the events leading up his departure. * MARCH 1993 -- Lopez and seven of his colleagues leave General Motors (GM) and its German unit Adam Opel AG and join Volkswagen AG (VW). * APRIL 1993 -- Opel initiates legal proceedings against Lopez at a court in Darmstadt, alleging industrial espionage to the detriment of Opel and GM. * MAY 1993 -- Opel tries to issue an employment ban at the regional court in Frankfurt, stopping seven of Lopez' colleagues from taking jobs at VW. The court denies the application, saying there was no legal basis for it. * JULY 1993 -- The Darmstadt prosecutor's office widens the scope of its investigations into Lopez and his colleagues. Investigators from the state prosecutors office discover confidential documents from Opel and GM in the Wiesbaden apartment of two former Opel managers. * JULY 1993 -- Prosecutors in Detroit begin investigations against Lopez and his colleagues. Speaking in an interview with Germany's Stern magazine, VW management board Chairman Ferdinand Piech describes the Lopez affair as "international economic war" against his company. * FEBRUARY 1994 -- The Frankfurt regional court rejects Opel's plea for an employment ban on its seven former managers in a hearing. * MAY 1994 -- Opel seeks a warrant against Lopez, saying it discovered new evidence. * JANUARY 1996 - The Darmstadt prosecutor's office ends its investigations and asks for a statement from Lopez. * MARCH 1996 -- GM and Opel initiate proceedings at a U.S. court in Detroit, seeking damages. The charge is criminal conspiracy and breach of confidentiality. * MAY 1996 -- VW initiates proceedings of its own at the regional court in Frankfurt for damages to its reputation against GM and Opel. * JUNE 1996 -- Provincial high court in Celle requires that VW defend the U.S. action by GM and Opel. * JULY 1996 -- VW contests GM's damages claim in the U.S. * OCTOBER 1996 -- Regional court in Frankfurt rejects VW's claims of damage to its reputation. In Detroit, a federal judge turns down VW's request to dismiss GM's civil suit and rules that top VW executives should remain defendants. * NOVEMBER 1996 Nov. 8 -- Legal sources say indictment against Lopez would come in 1996. Nov. 25 -- GM, Opel and VW decline to comment on reports of possible secret discussions between the parties on an out-of-court settlement. Nov. 26 -- Federal judge decides that Volkswagen can be prosecuted under a special law governing racketeering, organised crime and corruption. Nov. 27 -- As part of the conditions for an out-of-court settlement, GM and Opel demand that Lopez be fired. They also damages and a public apology. Nov. 29 -- VW (corrects company name from GM) says it has accepted Lopez' resignation.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG, cornered by adverse court rulings in its three-year legal fight with General Motors, on Friday sacrificed its production chief in an apparent bid to end the dispute. Volkswagen's supervisory board accepted a request by Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the cost-cutting crusader at the centre of industrial spying allegations, to resign immediately. But Europe's largest carmaker continued to maintain Lopez was innocent of allegation he stole industrial secrets from his former employer General Motors Corp or its German subsidiary Adam Opel AG. While both sides kept up a hard public face, speculation was widespread they planned talks towards an out-of-court settlement in the dispute, which might otherwise cost VW billions of dollars. "Investigations by independent auditors have given no indications that Opel secrets were passed on to VW, and no indications that Lopez colluded with VW employees to transfer secrets," VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen told a news conference. "No one can claim VW has acted improperly," Liesen said. Opel said Lopez's resignation alone was not adequate compensation for the damages it alleges the manager inflicted. "The resignation of Lopez is three years overdue and cannot compensate our company for the losses incurred to date," Opel said in a statement. There remained a need to establish personal responsibility in the case and to assess the damage done to date, it added. "Everyone who is interested in facts, the truth and in ensuring the good name of Volkswagen, will welcome legal procedures to clarify the situation," it said. VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech said VW and GM had discussed a settlement in three rounds of talks without conditions, and that VW would not bend to such conditions now. But GM said late in the day it would not talk further with VW unless VW met certain conditions. Piech said he hoped Lopez would continue to work for VW as a consultant. Liesen said Lopez's contract would have expired in March 1998, and that VW would meet its commitments to Lopez under the contract. He did not elaborate. Shares in VW reached a day's high of 619.70 marks in computer trade after the news of Lopez's resignation, which traders see as helping take some of the heat off VW in the dispute, but fell back to trade up 4.75 marks at 618.75 marks in later computer trade. VW has consistently denied accusations that Lopez and three other former GM executives now at VW stole boxes of secret documents and computer disks on purchasing and car production plans when they defected to VW in early 1993. Lawyers representing Lopez said he had asked to leave VW to concentrate on his defence and to fulfil a long-standing dream to set up a consultancy firm for industrial purchasing. Liesen said Lopez would not have been able to prepare his defence with sufficient intensity if he had stayed on. Pressure on VW to reach an out-of-court settlement rose sharply on Tuesday when a U.S. district judge in Detroit, GM's home town, ruled GM could pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and other VW executives, including VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech. Allowing the legal action to proceed under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO), which has been widely used to prosecute the mafia, trebles the amount of compensation VW would have to pay if found guilty. Industry sources say VW may have to pay billions of dollars. In a statement on Friday, the supervisory board expressly thanked Lopez for his "excellent" work. "The board said Mr Lopez as management board member applied himself for Volkswagen in an excellent way and achieved big successes through his high qualification as an engineer and his personal charisma," the statement said. Lopez, a Basque renowned for his ability to streamline production and cut carmaking costs, established innovative working practices at VW that helped return it to profitability. But media reports have speculated that Piech's own future may also be in doubt if the court action goes ahead. "At the moment there is nothing to suggest that his (Piech's) contract will not be extended," Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote in a commentary on Friday. "But who is to say what will happen if Piech has to face a U.S. court?" Sources close to GM said they did not expect Piech to back down in any out-of-court settlement but expected some movement from VW's supervisory board.
83167>>0>> Germany's DAX index charged upwards on Friday to end floor trade at a new all-time high, with the market spurred on by ever-stronger German government bonds and the continued firmness of the dollar. "Everything looks perfect, both the bond and the dollar. We could keep climbing," said one trader. The DAX index of Germany's top 30 stocks closed bourse dealings at 2,845.52 points, up 28.03 points, or 0.99 percent. Shares in the banking and chemical sectors led the assault. Later the IBIS DAX, which measures all-day computer trade in the DAX index, powered ahead even further to touch 2,854.59 points, before closing at 2,848.84 points, up 19.16 points, or 0.68 percent. The DAX has gained three percent in the last week alone, six percent in the last month, surprising commentators with the speed of the recent rally. Analysts said the climb could continue next week and until the year-end, when they see the DAX reaching the crucial 2,900 point level, although they said the market could pause briefly to catch its breath before charging on again. German government bonds have also been powering ahead, the Bund future reaching an all-time high of 102.59. Chemical stocks were particularly favoured in Friday's rally, heavily-weighted on the DAX, and as major exporters benefitting in particular from the firmer dollar. Shares in Bayer AG, BASF AG and Hoechst AG were all strongly ahead in the sector, while shares in banks were also firmer with Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank leading the way. Dealers said shares in Europe's largest car company Volkswagen were at the centre of attention, after the firm accepted the resignation of production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who is at the centre of a three year battle between VW and U.S. giant General Motors. Shares in VW slipped after the news to a day's low of 610.50 marks and then recovered to end bourse dealings up 3.50 marks at 616.50 marks. Dealers said they were not sure whether the Lopez resignation would mean the end of the legal battle, which was keeping the lid on any more significant recovery in the share price.
83167>>0>> German shares were expected to continue to soar next week, after hitting all-time highs on Friday, dealers said, although some said it would be no bad thing if the market took time to consolidate. The IBIS DAX, measuring electronic dealing in 30 leading shares, surged almost ten points above the day's bourse close to touch 2,854.59 points, before pairing gains slightly to stand up 19.21 points, or 0.68 percent, at 2,848.89 points. Continuing advances in the German bond market, a firmer dollar and a confident opening on Wall Street were all supporting the rally, dealers said.   Analysts said the crucial 2,900 point level was now in sight for the end of the year and said 3,000 point, once seen as unattainable could even be reached, with the fundamental environment still optimal for the market. They said much of the rally was sparked by a lack of alternative investment opportunities, given the low level of return in bond markets, where yields are at all-time lows. Meanwhile, dollar strength continued to boost export-oriented stocks, particularly in the chemicals sector, with Bayer, BASF and Hoechst all strongly ahead.   Volkswagen was seen continuing to dominate the news, after after the firm accepted the resignation of production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, at the centre of a three year battle between VW and General Motors.

83167>>0>> German carmaker Opel AG, a unit of U.S. giant General Motors Corp, said on Friday that the resignation of Volkswagen AG's production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez could not compensate for damages incurred by GM. "The resignation of Lopez is three years overdue and cannot compensate our company for the losses incurred to date," Opel said in a statement. The group went on to say that clarification was needed why the VW management had stood by Lopez for so long, adding further legal clarification was required in its ongoing dispute with Volkswagen.   Opel said that there remained a need to establish personal responsibility in the case and to assess the damage done to date. "Everyone who is interested in facts, the truth and on ensuring the good name of Volkswagen, will welcome legal procedures to clarify the situation," Opel said in its statement. Lopez resigned as production chief at Volkswagen earlier in the day. Opel sources said previously on Friday that talks to settle the three-year legal dispute between the two carmakers over alleged industrial espionage by Lopez and other senior VW employees were not taking place at the moment. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> General Motors Corp released a three-sentence statement Friday calling the resignation of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua from Volkswagen AG "long overdue." "The resignation of VW management board member Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua is a long-overdue first step that has been needlessly delayed for more than three years," GM spokesman John Mueller said in a prepared statement. "It is now time for Volkswagen management to address the real issues in this matter in a responsible manner rather than continue to create irrelevant side issues," Mueller said.   Lopez, the former purchasing head of GM who defected to Volkswagen in 1993, is at the center of international espionage charges filed by GM.  Lopez resigned from Volkswagen on Friday, saying he needs to concentrate on his legal defense as well as start his own consulting firm. In March, GM filed a civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Detroit alleging that Lopez and several associates stole confidential documents when they left for the German automaker.  The documents and computer files included parts prices as well as future product and manufacturing plans.   Lopez and VW have denied the charges. Lopez' resignation fulfills one of the demands from GM and its German Adam Opel AG unit.  The companies have also asked for unspecified financial compensation for the alleged damages. "The harm caused to GM and Opel by the wrongful conduct of Lopez and his collaborators remains to be remedied," Mueller said in the statement. GM officials declined to comment on whether the two sides are involved in settlement talks.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG, cornered by adverse court rulings in its three-year legal fight with General Motors Corp., on Friday sacrificed its production chief in an apparent bid to end the dispute. Three days after a court ruling stepped up pressure on VW, the company's supervisory board accepted the resignation of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the production official accused by GM of stealing documents when he and several others left GM to join Europe's largest automaker in 1993. Lawyers for Lopez said he had asked to resign to concentrate on his defence and to start his own consulting firm. VW praised the 55-year-old Lopez and continued to maintain that he did not steal industrial secrets from GM or its German subsidiary Adam Opel AG. While officials on both sides were tight-lipped, speculation swirled that the companies planned further talks to try to settle the dispute, which could end up costing VW billions of dollars if it loses in court. "Investigations by independent auditors have given no indications that Opel secrets were passed on to VW, and no indications that Lopez colluded with VW employees to transfer secrets," VW supervisory board Chairman Klaus Liesen told a news conference. "No one can claim VW has acted improperly," Liesen said. GM and its Opel unit said Lopez's resignation was long overdue and was not sufficient to settle the case. "The resignation of Lopez is three years overdue and cannot compensate our company for the losses incurred to date," Opel said in a statement. Pressure on VW to settle the case rose on Tuesday after a U.S. District Judge in Detroit, GM's home town, ruled that the world's largest automaker could pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and other VW executives, including VW Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech. Allowing the case to proceed under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO), which has been widely used to prosecute the Mafia, triples the amount of money VW would have to pay if found guilty. Industry sources said that could amount to billions of dollars. In its civil lawsuit filed in March, GM alleged that Lopez and several associates stole confidential documents when they left for the German automaker. VW has consistently denied accusations that Lopez and other former GM executives now at VW stole boxes of secret documents and computer disks on purchasing and car production plans when they defected to VW in early 1993. GM officials declined to comment on whether the two sides were holding settlement talks. VW's Piech said the two companies had discussed a settlement in three rounds of talks without conditions, and that VW would not bend to any conditions now. While Lopez' resignation fulfilled a key demand by GM and Opel, the companies have also asked for financial compensation and a public apology. A source at Opel said Friday that recent talks between the two sides went nowhere because GM and Opel officials felt VW's offer was not in the ballpark. "The offer VW made missed the point so completely that it made discussions on an out-of-court agreement impossible," the source said. A former GM manager who joined VW with Lopez will also resign, Piech told reporters, adding he hoped Lopez would continue to work for VW as a consultant. In a statement on Friday, VW's supervisory board thanked Lopez for his "excellent" work. A Basque known for his ability to streamline production and cut costs, Lopez established innovative working practices at VW that helped return it to profitability. Liesen said VW would meet its commitments under Lopez' contract, which was due to expire in March 1998. He did not elaborate.
83167>>0>> The dispute over Volkswagen's hiring of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua from General Motors has been going on for nearly four years now. Lopez, whose resignation was accepted by Volkswagen on Friday, has been at the centre of a three-year legal battle between VW and General Motors. Following are the events leading up his departure. * MARCH 1993 -- Lopez and seven of his colleagues leave General Motors (GM) and its German unit Adam Opel AG and joins Volkswagen AG (VW). * APRIL 1993 -- Opel initiates legal proceedings against Lopez at a court in Darmstadt, alleging industrial espionage to the detriment of Opel and GM. * MAY 1993 -- Opel tries to issue an employment ban at the regional court in Frankfurt, stopping seven of Lopez's colleagues from taking jobs at VW. The court denies the application, saying there was no legal basis for the application. * JULY 1993 -- The Darmstadt prosecutor's office widens the scope of its investigations into Lopez and his colleagues. Investigators from the state prosecutors office discover confidential documents from Opel and GM in the Wiesbaden apartment of two former Opel managers. Despite the accusations, VW stands by its new production chief. * JULY 1993 -- Prosecutors in Detroit begin investigations against Lopez and his colleagues. Speaking in an interview with Germany's Stern magazine, VW management board Chairman Ferdinand Piech describes the Lopez affair as "international economic war" against his company. * FEBRUARY 1994 -- The Frankfurt regional court rejects Opel's plea for an employment ban on its seven former managers in a hearing. * MAY 1994 -- Opel seeks a warrant against Lopez, saying it discovered new evidence. * JANUARY 1996 - The Darmstadt prosecutor's office ends its investigations and asks for a statement from Lopez. * MARCH 1996 -- GM and Opel initiate proceedings at a U.S. court in Detroit, seeking damages. The charge is criminal conspiracy and breach of confidentiality. * MAY 1996 -- VW initiates proceedings of its own at the regional court in Frankfurt for damages to its reputation against GM and Opel. * JUNE 1996 -- Provincial high court in Celle requires that VW defend the U.S. action by GM and Opel. * JULY 1996 -- VW contests GM's damages claim in the U.S. * OCTOBER 1996 -- Regional court in Frankfurt rejects VW's claims of damage to its reputation against GM/Opel. In Detroit, a federal judge turns down VW's request to dismiss GM's civil suit and rules that top VW executives should remain defendants. * NOVEMBER 1996 Nov. 8 -- Legal sources say indictment against Lopez would come in 1996.    Nov. 18 -- Braunschweig district says damages proceedings will take place in September 1997. Monday  -- GM, Opel and VW decline to comment on reports of possible secret discussions between the parties on an out-of-court settlement. Tuesday -- Federal judge decides that Volkswagen can be prosecuted under a special law governing racketeering, organised crime and corruption. Wednesday -- As part of the conditions for an out-of-court settlement, GM and Opel demand that Lopez be fired. On top of this condition they demand damages and a public apology. Thursday -- Company sources say that Lopez will tender his resignation from the board Friday. Friday -- GM announces that it had accepted a request by Lopez to resign immediately.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG, cornered by adverse court rulings in its three-year legal fight with General Motors, on Friday sacrificed its production chief in a possible first step towards ending the row. Volkswagen said its supervisory board had accepted the immediate resignation of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the cost-cutting crusader at the centre of industrial spying allegations. "The supervisory board acceded to the request of Mr Lopez at today's meeting and agreed to end his contract as management board member with effect from November 29," the carmaker said a brief statement released during a supervisory board meeting. VW's supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen would make a short statement at the start of a news conference at 1530 GMT, VW said. A spokesman declined to comment on whether a successor to Lopez had been appointed. VW has consistently denied accusations by GM and its German unit Adam Opel AG that Lopez and three other former GM executives now at VW stole boxes of secret documents and computer disks on purchasing and car production plans when they defected to VW in early 1993. Lawyers representing Lopez said in a statement that he had asked to leave VW to concentrate on his defence and to fulfil a long-standing dream to set up a consultancy firm for industrial purchasing. Lopez had been widely expected to offer his resignation and the supervisory board, keen to end a battle which threatens to cost VW billions of dollars and do irreparable harm to its reputation, had been expected to accept. Pressure on VW to reach an out-of-court settlement rose sharply on Tuesday when a U.S. district judge in Detroit, GM's home town, ruled GM could pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and other VW executives, including VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech. Allowing the legal action to proceed under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO), which has been widely used to prosecute the mafia, trebles the amount of compensation VW would have to pay if found guilty. Industry sources say VW may have to pay billions of dollars. Opel this week demanded that VW sack Lopez, apologise publicly and pay compensation in return for an out-of-court deal. Sources close to Opel said on Friday that Lopez's resignation alone was not enough. But VW, led by Piech, has given Lopez its full backing throughout the bitter dispute. In Friday's statement, the supervisory board expressly thanked Lopez for his "excellent" work. "The board said Mr Lopez as management board member applied himself for Volkswagen in an excellent way and achieved big successes through his high qualification as an engineer and his personal charisma," the statement said. Lopez, a Basque renowned for his ability to streamline production and cut carmaking costs, established innovative working practices at VW that helped return it to profitability. But media reports have speculated that Piech's own future may also be in doubt if the court action goes ahead. "At the moment there is nothing to suggest that his (Piech's) contract will not be extended," Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote in a commentary on Friday. "But who is to say what will happen if Piech has to face a U.S. court?" Both VW and Opel have officially denied media reports that they have been negotiating an out-of-court settlement, but sources close to GM said VW supervisory board chairman Liesen had made contact with GM over the matter. The sources said GM did not expect Piech to back down but expected some movement from VW's supervisory board. The U.S. court decision was the latest in a series of blows for VW. Last week a Frankfurt court decided to hand over German prosecution documents on VW to the U.S. Justice Department, which is conducting its own investigation and requested the papers more than two years ago. Meanwhile, Lopez' own lawyers have said they expect German prosecutors to file criminal charges of industrial spying in a German court by the end of November. And a Frankfurt judge last month dismissed a VW lawsuit charging Opel with defamation. VW plans to appeal.
83167>>0>> General Motors Corp. said Friday it was not prepared to talk further with Germany's Volkswagen AG to try to resolve a three-year battle over alleged corporate espionage unless VW met certain conditions. The statement, by GM's European headquarters in Zurich, came after Volkswagen said its board had accepted the resignation of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, whom GM has accused of industrial spying. At a news conference at VW's headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, VW Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech said VW would not take part in talks aimed at a settlement with GM if preconditions were set. GM had demanded the firing of VW executive Lopez, who allegedly stole industrial secrets before joining VW from GM, before discussing a settlement. "An out of court settlement is out of the question until VW management admits it acted illegally, publicly apologises, accepts responsibility and no longer enjoys the services of Mr. Lopez," a GM spokesman said in Zurich. "If our demands are not met, we cannot hold talks on a settlement," the spokesman added. VW accepted Lopez's resignation on Friday, but Piech said later he planned to hire the Spaniard as a consultant.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG management board chairman Ferdinand Piech said VW plans no further personnel changes following the departure of production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. VW will not suffer any losses due to Lopez's departure, Piech said.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen declined to comment on whether VW was in settlement talks with General Motors German unit Adam Opel AG. Liesen told a news conference VW would only enter negotiations with GM or Opel if there were no preconditions. VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech said he hoped departing production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua would continue to work for VW as a consultant, and that he would be happy to continue to employ Lopez.   VW 's Liesen-no comment on settlement "I would happily continue to employ him for the rest of my life," Piech told the news conference. Asked whether VW now planned to enter talks toward an out-of-court settlement with GM, Piech said VW had already sought three times to reach such a settlement, and that on each occasion the talks had been without preconditions. "I cannot imagine that we would enter into talks with preconditions after having done so three times without," Piech said. Liesen said Lopez's contract would have expired in March 1998, and that VW would meet its commitments to Lopez under the contract. He did not elaborate. -- Bonn newsroom, 49 228 26097150
83167>>0>> General Motors did not accept Volkswagen AG's proposals during discussions on a possible out-of-court settlement as it thought the VW offer was not comprehensive enough, a source at carmaker Opel said on Friday. "The offer VW made missed the point so completely that it made discussions on an out-of-court agreement impossible," the source said. There were no discussions on resolving the three-year legal dispute at the moment, the source said. Opel never left any doubt that it was ready for discussions, the source said. However, the source went on to say that comments from VW about an agreement, which helped the VW share price, meant that Opel was forced to come out with a declaration of principle and set out conditions for an agreement. Opel, the German unit of GM, said earlier on Friday that the resignation of Volkswagen production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez could not compensate for damages incurred by GM. It was now a question of establishing the amount of damages, a public apology and a public acceptance of responsibility and the removal of Lopez's seven colleagues, who left with Lopez to move to Volkswagen, the source said. "The scapegoat Lopez has no longer any role to play in the game given the current amount of legal pressure," said the source. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Workers at Volkswagen AG's plant showed no concern on Friday at the fate of production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who stepped down to concentrate on his defence in a U.S. lawsuit brought by his former employer General Motors. "VW could not hold onto Lopez any longer," said one employee, asked outside the plant to comment on Lopez's resignation. "He was good for VW from an economic point of view but the productivity gains he achieved were won on the backs of the workers. "German authorities were too sluggish in dealing with the whole affair. U.S. authorities were quicker, and the problem for our plant is that we will lose our market in the U.S. if this goes on." GM and its German unit Adam Opel AG allege that Lopez and three other former GM executives now at VW stole secret documents and computer disks when they defected to VW in 1993. A U.S. district judge in Detroit recently ruled GM could pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and other VW executives, including chief executive Ferdinand Piech. VW may have to pay billions of dollars in the case. Lopez, renowned as a cost-cutter, had won few friends among the workers. "I think it is good he left," said another worker, who also asked not to be identified. "He should have left three years ago. "I don't think he is going to be the only one to go," the second worker added, voicing a widespread belief that the three colleagues who came with Lopez from GM would also be under pressure to leave VW. A third employee said, "He did a lot of good for the company, but we don't know what went on behind the scenes." -- Bonn newsroom, 49-228-26097150
83167>>0>> Germany's DAX index charged upwards on Friday to end floor trade at a new all-time high, with the market spurred on by ever-stronger German government bonds and the continued firmness of the dollar. "Everything looks perfect, both the bond and the dollar. We could keep climbing," said one trader. The DAX index of Germany's top 30 stocks closed bourse dealings at 2,845.52 points, up 28.03 points, or 0.99 percent. Shares in the banking and chemical sectors led the assault. The DAX has gained three percent in the last week alone, six percent in the last month, surprising commentators with the speed of the recent rally. Meanwhile German government bonds have also been powering ahead, the Bund future reaching an all-time high of 102.17. Both bond and share markets had been expected to trade quietly at the end of the week, with markets closed in the U.S. on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and many players expected to be absent on Friday. But the German markets powered ahead regardless. Chemical stocks were particularly favoured in Friday's rally, heavily-weighted on the DAX, and as major exporters benefitting in particular from the firmer dollar. Shares in Bayer AG, BASF AG and Hoechst AG were all strongly ahead in the sector, while shares in banks were also firmer with Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank leading the way.

Dealers said they were not sure whether the Lopez resignation would mean the end of the legal battle, which was keeping the lid on any more significant recovery in the share price.

83167>>0>> Shares in Europe's largest carmaker Volkswagen edged slightly higher on Friday after the firm accepted the resignation of a top manager at the centre of a legal battle between VW and U.S. giant General Motors. Shares in VW reached a day's high of 617 marks after the news, but then fell back slightly to trade up three marks at 616 marks by 1203 GMT. Meanwhile, the rest of the market was much firmer at record highs, the DAX index of leading shares up 0.86 percent at 2,841.58 points. VW shares had slipped six percent down from a year high of 642.50 points on Wednesday on worries that VW could face bigger damages than previously expected in a U.S. court case for alleged industrial espionage. But dealers said they were not exactly sure whether the Lopez resignation would mean the end of the legal battle, which was keeping the lid on any more significant recovery in the share price. Earlier on Friday sources at GM's German unit Opel said the resigantion of Lopez would not be enough of a basis for a settlement in the current legal dispute, which pushed the VW share price lower. But dealers said the stock was strongly supported around 600 marks, a level it tested on Wednesday. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525

Asked by Reuters Television whether a decision had been reached on a successor to Lopez, Volkswagen spokesman Klaus Kocks said: "We don't want to make any further statement at present because the supervisory board chairman is ready to hold further talks this afternoon." Kocks did not elaborate further. Lopez has been at the centre of a three-year row between VW and General Motors and has been accused of industrial espionage. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525

His lawyers said that on the one hand he wanted to concentrate on his defence in proceedings. "On the other hand, he also would like to fulfil a long-held wish to set up a consultancy company to offer industry access to his knowledge and experience on a wider basis," the lawyers said.

83167>>0>> WOLFSBURG, Germany, Nov 29 - German carmaker Volkswagen AG said its supervisory board would make a statement on Friday if it reaches a decision at its meeting. VW has so far declined official comment on media reports that its production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, at the centre of a three-year legal battle with General Motors, is likely to offer his resignation. "If the supervisory board reaches a decision that would require a statement, it will make a statement," VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said in response to a Reuters enquiry.   The carmaker some time ago scheduled a news conference for 1530 GMT on Friday about its contribution to the Expo 2000 world exhibition in Hanover. That news conference now looks set to be inundated by media seeking news about Lopez's future. Sources close to the company say VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen will read out a statement before the news conference. Lopez, 55, is at the centre of a three-year industrial espionage battle with his former employer General Motors, which has accused him of stealing production secrets when he defected to VW in March 1993.

Volkswagen said in a brief statement that its supervisory board had accepted a request by Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the cost-cutting crusader at the centre of industrial spying allegations, to resign immediately. "The supervisory board acceded to the request of Mr Lopez at today's meeting and agreed to end his contract as management board member with effect from November 29," the carmaker said a statement released during a supervisory board meeting. But Opel AG, GM's German unit, made clear that Lopez' resignation alone was not going to be adequate compensation for the damages it alleges have been inflicted by the manager. "The resignation of Lopez is three years overdue and cannot compensate our company for the losses incurred to date," Opel said in a statement. It said clarification was needed as to why VW's management had stood by Lopez for so long and called for further legal clarification in the ongoing dispute with Volkswagen. There remained a need to establish personal responsibility in the case and to assess the damage done to date, Opel added. "Everyone who is interested in facts, the truth and on ensuring the good name of Volkswagen, will welcome legal procedures to clarify the situation," it said. Shares in VW reached a day's high of 617 marks after the news of Lopez's resignation, which traders see as helping take some of the heat off VW in the dispute, but fell back to trade up 50 pfennigs at 614.50 marks in later computer trade. VW has consistently denied accusations by GM and its German unit Adam Opel AG that Lopez and three other former GM executives now at VW stole boxes of secret documents and computer disks on purchasing and car production plans when they defected to VW in early 1993. Lawyers representing Lopez said he had asked to leave VW to concentrate on his defence and to fulfil a long-standing dream to set up a consultancy firm for industrial purchasing. Lopez had been widely expected to offer his resignation and the supervisory board, keen to end a battle which threatens to cost VW billions of dollars and do irreparable harm to its reputation, had been expected to accept. Pressure on VW to reach an out-of-court settlement rose sharply on Tuesday when a U.S. district judge in Detroit, GM's home town, ruled GM could pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and other VW executives, including VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech. Allowing the legal action to proceed under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO), which has been widely used to prosecute the mafia, trebles the amount of compensation VW would have to pay if found guilty. Industry sources say VW may have to pay billions of dollars. Opel had demanded that VW sack Lopez, apologise publicly and pay compensation in return for an out-of-court deal. But VW, led by Piech, has given Lopez its full backing throughout the bitter dispute. In Friday's statement, the supervisory board expressly thanked Lopez for his "excellent" work. "The board said Mr Lopez as management board member applied himself for Volkswagen in an excellent way and achieved big successes through his high qualification as an engineer and his personal charisma," the statement said. Lopez, a Basque renowned for his ability to streamline production and cut carmaking costs, established innovative working practices at VW that helped return it to profitability. But media reports have speculated that Piech's own future may also be in doubt if the court action goes ahead. "At the moment there is nothing to suggest that his (Piech's) contract will not be extended," Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote in a commentary on Friday. "But who is to say what will happen if Piech has to face a U.S. court?" Sources close to GM said they did not expect Piech to back down in any out-of-court settlement but expected some movement from VW's supervisory board.
83167>>0>> General Motors Corp said on Friday that it would not be prepared to talk further with Germany's Volkswagen AG in a bid to resolve a three-year battle over alleged espionage unless VW met certain conditions. The statement was made by GM's European headquarters in Zurich. It followed a news conference at VW's headquarters in Wolfsburg at which the company's chief executive Ferdinand Piech said VW would not take part in talks aimed at reaching a settlement if preconditions were set.   GM had demanded the sacking of VW executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who allegedly stole industrial secrets before joining VW from GM, before discussing a settlement. "An out of court settlement is out of the question until VW management admits it acted illegally, publicly apologises, accepts responsibility and no longer enjoys the services of Herr Lopez," a GM spokesman said in Zurich. "If our demands are not met, we cannot hold talks on a settlement," the spokesman added. VW accepted Lopez's resignation on Friday, but Piech said later he planned to hire the Spaniard as a consultant. -- Bonn newsroom, 49-228-26097150

83167>>0>> In a rare statement from shadowy spymasters, Mongolia's Centre for Espionage has denied spying on former-communist opposition politicians since a general election swept them from power in June. But the centre, known in Mongolian as the TTG, said that before the June elections it had spied on journalists on behalf of the former-communist Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP) which had ruled this north Asian nation. "We announce that the (current) government of Mongolia has not ordered the TTG to spy on any political individual or group," the centre said in a statement seen on Friday.. "The TTG conducts only legal activities," it said. MPRP officials have in recent weeks accused Mongolia's new government of democratic reformers of using the TTG's agents to spy on them for political gain and have demanded the resignation of Prime Minister M. Enkhsaikhan. The Mongolian parliament has formed a group to investigate the accusations which the TTG has dismissed as false. "Statements made by the MPRP are based on false information," it said, accusing the former communists of illegally contacting TTG staff. The new reformist government recently sacked the head of the espionage centre and other key figures in the organisation. While denying wrong-doing in the recent past, the centre said it had conducted questionable activities under the MPRP. "There are documents that prove that... the TTG spied on some people in the media without justification and that it carried out very active espionage during the 1996 general election," it said. It gave no details of the targets of surveillance during the elections in which the MPRP suffered a crushing blow, losing 45 of the 70 seats it had held in the Great Hural, or parliament. The MPRP newspaper Truth on Wednesday quoted party leader N. Enkhbayar as saying the party had recently been spied on by the Centre for Espionage. "We have information that at the least there has been monitoring of phone calls, tailing of people and the controlling of some journalists," Enkhbayar was quoted as saying.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG, Europe's largest carmaker, said on Friday it had accepted the resignation of production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, thanking Lopez for his excellent work. Lopez has been at the centre of a three-year legal battle between VW and General Motors.
83167>>0>> HANOVER, Germany, Nov 29 - German carmaker Volkswagen AG denied a radio report on Friday that its production chief at the centre of a lgal battle with U.S. giant General Motors had offered to resign. A report on north German radio said Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, at the centre of the three-year legal battle with GM, had offered to resign at VW'se supervisory board meeting, which started at 0800 GMT on Friday. The company said the its supervisory board would make a statement if it reached a decision at the meeting. VW spokesman Klaus Kocks denied the radio report, saying: "That cannot be, they have not discussed the matter yet." VW has so far declined comment on media reports that Lopez, accused by his former employer GM of stealing secret documents on purchasing and car production plans when he moved to VW in March 1993, was likely to offer his resignation, and the board was likely to accept it. "If the supervisory board reaches a decision that would require a statement, it will make a statement," Kocks said. VW had earlier scheduled a news conference for 1530 GMT on Friday, after the board meeting ends, about its activities at the Expo 2000 world exhibition in Hanover. The supervisory board is due to reach a decision on those activities at Friday's meeting. But the news conference looks set to be dominated by media questions about the future of Lopez, a Spaniard renowned for his cost-cutting abilities, who VW after it reported a one billion mark loss. He is credited with helping returning VW to profitability since. Otto Ferdinand Wachs, an executive overseeing VW's activities at Expo 2000, and Robert Buechelhofer, a member of Expo 2000's supervisory board, are scheduled to hold the news conference. VW on Wednesday rejected a demand by GM's German subsidiary Adam Opel AG to fire Lopez, apologise publicly and pay compensation in return for an out-of-court settlement in a U.S. civil lawsuit filed by Opel and GM. Pressure on VW to reach a settlement mounted this week after a U.S. judge in Detroit, GM's home town, ruled GM could pursue racketeering charges against Lopez and other VW executives, including VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech. The decision trebles the amount of compensation VW would have to pay if found guilty and could confront the carmaker with a bill totalling billions of dollars. Meanwhile, sources close to Opel on Friday said Lopez's departure on its own would not suffice to bring about an out-of-court deal. "Lopez stepping down would only be a symbolic move, a long-overdue decision which will have come too late," one Opel source said.
83167>>0>> WOLFSBURG, Germany, Nov 29 Reuter) - A Volkswagen AG spokesman on Friday denied a radio report that VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua had already offered to resign. "That cannot be, they have not discussed the matter yet," VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said in response to a Reuters enquiry. The report on local north German radio had said that Lopez had offered to resign. It cited a member of the VW supervisory board. The supervisory board started meeting at 0800 GMT on Friday amid reports that Lopez, at the centre of a three-year legal battle with General Motors, would offer to step down. Lopez is acccused of industrial espionage. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> The resignation of Volkswagen production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua on its own would not be enough of a basis for a settlement with General Motors in the current legal dispute, Opel sources said on Friday. "Lopez stepping down would only be a symbolic move, a long-overdue decision which will have come too late," the Opel sources said. Talks to settle the three-year legal dispute between the two carmakers over alleged industrial espionage by Lopez and other senior VW employees were not taking place at the moment, the sources told Reuters.   Opel, GM's German unit, said that the time for which Lopez had been employed by Volkswagen would stand in direct relation to the amount of damages GM/Opel would seek from its rival, sources at Opel headquarters in Ruesselsheim said. On Wednesday Opel said that it was looking for a public apology and damages, as well as Lopez's resignation. Opel said that "substantial reparation for damages" was the most important condition for a settlement. The company has not put a figure on the amount of damages it is seeking. GM/Opel has accused Lopez and other senior managers now with Volkswagen of taking strategically-important company information with them when they left their positions at Opel to move to VW. Volkswagen some time ago scheduled a news conference for 1530 GMT on Friday on the exhibition EXPO 2000, which now looks set to be inundated by media seeking news about Lopez's future. VW said earlier that its supervisory board would make a statement on Friday if it reaches a decision at its meeting. Media reports have said that Lopez is likely to offer his resignation at the meeting. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525

83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp are near a settlement in their legal battle over whether Jose Ignacio Lopez stole GM secrets when he defected to VW in 1993, the news weekly Der Spiegel said on Saturday. The executive resigned as VW's production chief on Friday. VW could face penalties totalling billions of dollars after a U.S. court decided earlier this week the GM complaint could proceed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO). In an advance release from Monday's edition, Spiegel said VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen and Lower Saxony state premier Gerhard Schroeder had drawn up a proposed out-of-court settlement with GM executive committee chairman John Smale. Lower Saxony is VW's largest shareholder. Asked in an interview with the Sueddeutsche Zeitung about the chances for a settlement, Liesen said: "Time will tell." Liesen said prosecution under RICO required proof of a conspiracy, a story he said not even the GM side could believe. Spiegel said now that Lopez had left VW, fulfilling the first of GM's conditions, Smale had signalled GM might soften its other demands for an apology and a financial settlement. The proposed deal included a commitment by VW to buy GM parts, but Smale's plan had opponents within GM who were insisting the case go to court, the magazine said. Spiegel said Lopez would receive a four million mark settlement for leaving VW, the value of his contract up to its expiry in 1998. Bild newspaper reported the value of the settlement was 11 million marks. Meanwhile Focus magazine said GM's German subsidiary Adam Opel AG was among the hardline factions insisting on the fulfilment of the remaining conditions. A VW spokesman said the company would have no comment on the reports. -- Terence Gallagher, Bonn newsroom, 49 228 26097150
83167>>0>> A Mongolian parliamentary committee said it had found evidence to back allegations that Mongolia's shadowy spymasters, the Centre for Espionage, had conducted illegal surveillance of the opposition. The Centre for Espionage, known in Mongolian as the TTG, had bugged telephones of the opposition and was suspected of conducting other unspecified activities, a spokesman for the group of parliamentary investigators told a news conference late on Saturday. "These activities have been proved by written documents and witnesses," T. Nyamdorj told reporters. The Centre for Espionage issued a rare statement last week denying allegations by the ex-communist Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP), which ruled until elections last June, that it had spied on the new opposition. However, it admitted spying on reporters under the former MPRP government. MPRP officials have in recent weeks accused Mongolia's new government of democratic reformers of using the centre's agents to spy on the opposition for political gain and have demanded the resignation of Prime Minister M. Enkhsaikhan. All the investigators, members of parliament from the ruling Democratic Union Coalition, the MPRP and the tiny National Unity Party, had agreed that there was evidence of recent violations of the law by the centre, Nyamdorj said. The evidence showed the Centre for Espionage had listened in on MPRP General Secretary N. Enkhbayar's telephone calls but attempts to bug the phone of former prime minister P. Jasrai had failed due to technical reasons, he said. "It is not clear what lies behind this," Nyamdorj said, referring to other suspected cases. "People who are in charge of this do not respond and do not show the documents." Asked whether Prime Minister M. Enkhsaikhan had ordered the illegal activities, he said: "There is no such document." "The leader of the TTG has the right to conduct investigations independently," he said. Nyamdorj said investigators had recommended the government dismiss the head of the TTG, J. Baatar, and "take all measures to ensure that the TTG...is not carrying out illegal activities". The investigators had briefed the prime minister and the parliament speaker on Friday evening, Nyamdorj said. "The government has not yet responded," he said. "On such an issue, it is necessary that the state takes action fast and with courage," he said.
83167>>0>> Officials at General Motors Corp.'s German subsidiary denied Sunday that the companies were close to settling a 3-1/2-year-old dispute with Volkswagen AG over alleged industrial espionage. "There are no settlement negotiations," said an official at Adam Opel AG, the German subsidiary, denying a report in the magazine Der Spiegel that a settlement had been drawn up by top managers from both sides and was awaiting GM approval. GM maintains that former executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who resigned on Friday from VW, stole GM secrets when he defected to VW in 1993. A VW plant in Brazil, whose construction Lopez supervised, is said to draw strongly on earlier plans by Opel for a "Plant X." VW officials declined to comment Sunday. VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech said on Friday that the two sides had met three times to discuss a settlement. The Opel sources, who declined to be named, said the fact that Piech suggested Lopez could continue to work as a consultant for VW could delay the settlement VW seeks. VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen on Friday praised Lopez's performance and said VW would meet its obligations under his contract, which ran through March 1998. German media reports said Lopez would receive from 4 million German marks ($2.6 million) to 11 million marks ($7.2 million) in compensation. VW could face penalties totalling billions of dollars in a suit brought by GM in the United States. A U.S. judge said last week that GM could pursue its complaint under U.S. racketeering laws, which means GM could ask for triple damages in the case. A "status conference" in the case is scheduled for Tuesday, where lawyers for the two sides will outline their plans for further proceedings. The Opel source said the judge was likely to ask at that session about the prospects for an out-of-court settlement. GM lawyers are likely to repeat their standing position that there are no ongoing settlement negotiations. GM has publicly set three conditions for a settlement: Lopez's departure from VW, a public apology, and a financial settlement. Opel officials have said that Lopez's resignation was a diversionary tactic that does not satisfy the first of GM's conditions for a settlement. Spiegel reported that Liesen and Lower Saxony state premier Gerhard Schroeder had drawn up a proposed out-of-court settlement with GM executive committee chairman John Smale. Lower Saxony is VW's largest shareholder. Spiegel reported that now that Lopez has left VW, Smale had signalled GM might soften its other demands for an apology and a financial settlement. The proposed deal included a commitment by VW to buy GM parts, but Smale's plan had opponents within GM who were insisting the case go to court, the magazine said. Lopez was reported to be at home in Spain, resting and concentrating on his defence in the case.

83167>>0>> The captain of the Tanzanian ferry Bukoba, which sank last May in Lake Victoria with the loss of up to 900 lives, appeared in court on Monday to face charges of murder, a police official said. The captain, Jumanne Rume, appeared in Mwanza district court along with two senior transport officials of the Bukoba and Kemondo Bay ports, said the Mwanza-based police official, who asked not to be named. No other details were available. Tanzanian media quoted the Mwanza regional police commander, Ignas Mtana, as saying the three men, all employees of the state-owned Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC), were arrested last week and had been held under tight security. The Belgian-designed ferry was on a routine journey between the ports of Bukoba and Mwanza on May 21 when it capsized at the entrance to Mwanza harbour. A bungled attempt to rescue passengers trapped inside the upturned hull ended in disaster and the ship sank in about 30 metres (100 ft) of water. Eyewitnesses and survivors said the ferry was massively overloaded with cargo and passengers. Complaints have also been raised about its seaworthiness and the fact that the TRC did not have the vessel insured.
83167>>0>> A federal judge Monday denied Volkswagen AG's motions to dismiss General Motors Corp.'s remaining industrial espionage claims against the German automaker, clearing the way for GM's U.S. lawsuit to proceed. In the ruling, U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds allowed GM to pursue claims that Volkswagen and several of its top executives violated copyright, trademark and unfair competition laws in an alleged scheme to steal GM trade secrets.   Last week, Edmunds allowed GM's claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act -- which could lead to triple damages against VW -- to proceed. With Monday's decision, she has denied virtually every Volkswagen motion in the case so far. GM sued VW and its former production chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua in March, alleging that he masterminded a scheme to steal confidential GM data when he left the Detroit automaker in 1993 to join Volkswagen. Lopez announced his resignation from VW on Friday, a move that fuelled speculation that the case might soon be settled out of court. But GM spokesman John Mueller said Monday that GM has not held settlement talks with VW and was prepared to let the case proceed. On Tuesday, Edmunds will hold a status conference with lawyers from both sides to set a schedule and procedures for discovery, the process of taking sworn statements from witnesses and disclosure of other evidence in the case. "Judge Edmunds' decision today denies motions by the defendants tp dismiss GM's and Opel's allegations of wrongdoing under the U.S. federal copyright laws and the Lanham Act," which is the federal unfair competition law, Mueller said. "Her decision supports our position and clears the way for those allegations to be heard in the upcoming trial along with our RICO claims."
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech Monday took over some of the responsibilities of the VW executive who resigned amid an industrial espionage dispute with General Motors Corp. An internal memo by Piech to top VW executives dated Monday said Piech has taken over group-wide control of "product optimization and procurement" following the resignation last Friday of VW production guru Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. Lopez, dubbed the "cost killer" and credited with helping the turnaround at VW after it posted a billion-mark loss ($650 million) in 1993, is the target of a German criminal probe into allegations he stole secret documents when he left GM that year. Lawyers for Spanish-born 55-year-old Lopez, who is also named in a U.S. racketeering lawsuit filed by GM and its German subsidiary Adam Opel AG, resigned to prepare his defence against the U.S. charges and other legal issues. GM and Opel executives have declined to predict how much they would seek in a trial but observers have speculated at between $4 billion and $5 billion -- an amount which could be tripled under a U.S. racketeering law first used to fight organised crime. The management reshuffling at VW included the naming of Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, who followed Lopez to VW from GM, to the VW management board from his current position as a senior executive at VW's Spanish subisidary SEAT. Garcia Sanz will oversee VW purchasing activities, according to the memo obtained by Reuters. VW executive Peter Hartz was also named to take over Lopez's duties with VW's America and Africa units. Piech made the management changes as VW stock fell nearly 6 percent on Monday after GM said it would not let up on its legal battle against the Wolfsburg-based carmaker, Europe's biggest. Volkswagen shares fell 34.50 marks to 582 marks ($375) but pared some of the losses to end bourse trade down 29.50 marks at 587 marks ($378). Speculation about a possible out-of-court deal over the U.S. lawsuit rose after Lopez quit his post on Friday -- one of the conditions GM laid down for any settlement. Opel Chief Executive David Herman told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published Monday that a deal was "desirable" but reaffirmed that GM and Opel still wanted a public apology from VW as well as hefty monetary damages. VW officials have said they would not meet the conditions and have denied the allegations made by the U.S. auto giant. GM officials also said statements from VW that Lopez would stay with VW as a consultant were insulting, saying they wanted Lopez never to work again for VW. GM officials also said they were astounded at VW saying it would meet the obligations of Lopez's contract, which runs through March 1998. A VW official said Lopez would get about 4 million marks ($2.6 million) for his contract that runs through March 1998. "This is absolutely not sufficient," said one GM executive who asked not to be identified. "Letting him resign and then having top executives praise him and say that they can see him as a top consultant in the future does not meet our requirements." Lopez was credited with slashing, by some reports, up to 17 billion marks ($11 billion) in costs by cutting the prices it pays to component suppliers, which can make up half the cost of a car, and by opting to buy more parts from eastern Europe. VW started courting Lopez in 1992 after Piech, the grandson of luxury sportscar manufacturer Ferdinand Porsch, took over control at the carmaker with plans to restore VW's fortunes. GM claims that Lopez started leaking information about Opel's plans as early as December 1992 and that he asked for a briefing on future plans just hours before he quit GM in March 1993 and took along a number of executives with him. A meeting among lawyers in the U.S. lawsuit, which also names Piech as a defendant, with the Judge Nancy Edmunds is scheduled for Tuesday in Detroit. The meeting, called a "status conference," will decide on how both sides will proceed with the sworn testimony of defendants and witnesses. Discussion of a settlement at the meeting was not expected to take place, industry sources said.

GM and Opel executives have declined to predict how much they would seek in a trial but observers have speculated at between $4 billion and $5 billion -- an amount which could be tripled under a U.S. racketeering law first used to fight the mafia. The management reshuffling at VW included the naming of Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, who followed Lopez to VW from GM, to the VW management board from his current position as a senior executive at VW's Spanish subisidary SEAT. Garcia Sanz will be on the VW management board to oversee VW purchasing activities, according to the memo obtained by Reuters. VW executive Peter Hartz was also named to take over Lopez's duties with VW's America and Africa units. Piech made the management changes as VW shares on Monday fell nearly six percent after GM said it would not let up on its legal battle against the Wolfsburg-based carmaker, Europe's biggest. Volkswagen shares fell 34.50 marks to 582 marks but pared some of the losses, which were tied to foreign sellers, to end bourse trade down 29.50 marks at 587 marks. Speculation about a possible out-of-court deal over the U.S. lawsuit has risen after Lopez quit his post on Friday -- one of the conditions GM laid down for any settlement. Opel chief executive David Herman told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Monday that a deal was "desirable" but reaffirmed that GM and Opel still wanted a public apology from VW as well as hefty monetary damages. VW officials have said they would not meet the conditions and have denied the allegations made by the U.S. auto giant. GM officials on Monday also said statements from VW that Lopez will stay with VW as a consultant were insulting, saying they wanted Lopez never to work again for VW. GM officials were also astounded at VW saying it would meet the obligations of Lopez's contract, which runs through March 1998. A VW official said Lopez would get about four million marks ($2.60 million) for his contract that runs through March 1998. "This is absolutely not sufficient," said one GM executive who asked not to be named. "Letting him resign and then having top executives praise him and say that they can see him as a top consultant in the future does not meet our requirements." ($1=1.5414 Mark)
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG chief executive Ferdinand Piech on Monday took over some of the responsibilities of a VW executive who resigned amid an industrial espionage row with rival carmaker Opel. An internal memo by Piech to top VW executives dated on Monday said Piech has taken over group-wide control of "product optimisation and procurement" following the resignation last Friday of VW production guru Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. Lopez, dubbed the "cost killer" and credited with helping the turnaround at VW after it posted a billion-mark loss in 1993, is the target of a German criminal probe into allegations he stole secret documents when he left Opel AG that year.

"This is absolutely not sufficient," said one GM executive who asked not to be named. "Letting him resign and then having top executives praise him and say that they can see him as a top consultant in the future does not meet our requirements." Lopez was credited with slashing, by some reports, up to 17 billion marks in costs by cutting the prices it pays to component suppliers, which can make up half the cost of a car, and by opting to buy more parts from eastern Europe. VW started courting Lopez in 1992 after Piech, the grandson of luxury sportscar manufacturer Ferdinand Porsch, took over control at the carmaker with plans to restore VW's fortunes. GM claims that Lopez started leaking information about Opel's plans as early as December 1992 and that he asked for a briefing on future plans just hours before he quit GM in March 1993 and took along a number of executives with him. A meeting among lawyers in the U.S. lawsuit, which also names VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech as a defendant, with the Judge Nancy Edmunds is scheduled for Tuesday in Detroit. The meeting, called a "status conference," will decide on how both sides will proceed with the sworn testimony of defendants and witnesses.

83167>>0>> The German DAX index of 30 leading shares ended bourse dealings at a record close on Monday, continuing the rally started last week, with the market boosted by a firmer dollar and strength on Wall Street. The DAX index hit a new bourse record of 2,860.24 points in early trade, before paring gains slightly to close up 13.08 points, or 0.46 percent, at 2,858.60 points. Analysts had not been expecting the 2,850 point level to be breached until the end of the year, but the DAX has rallied strongly in the last week, gaining three percent, boosted by dollar strength, benefiting German exporters. The dollar climbed above the crucial 1.54 mark level on Monday, reaching its highest point for almost six weeks, encouraging the exporting chemical sector in particular. BASF AG, Bayer AG and Hoechst AG shares all rose strongly. The DAX surge came despite heavy losses in shares of Europe's largest carmaker, Volkswagen AG, which ended down almost five percent, or 29.50 marks at 587 marks. Dealers said the rush to sell had been sparked by foreign investors, worried about VW's ongoing legal dispute with U.S. carmaker General Motors Corp. "It's been a catastrophic day for VW shares," one dealer said. On Friday, VW accepted the resignation of production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez, at the centre of the legal battle, which the market took as a signal that a settlement could be reached between the two sides. But GM made no signal of being ready to compromise and the market speculated that the amount of damages VW may ultimately have to pay could be as high as 7.5 billion marks. Meanwhile, shares in Germany's largest bank Deutsche Bank fell 35 pfennigs to end at 72.95 marks after a newspaper reported its asset management unit Morgan Grenfell would have to repatriate 200 million sterling. Deutsche Bank called the 200 million sterling figure "speculation", but admitted it would have to pay an unspecified level of compensation to investors.
83167>>0>> German carmaker Volkswagen AG on Monday said it has named a number of new top executives following the resignation last week of embattled production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. VW said management board chairman Ferdinand Piech has taken over responsibility for Lopez's production optimisation area and that management board member Peter Hartz has taken over responsibility for South American and African operatons. In addition, VW said Javier Garcia Sanz, currently an executive vice president at VW subsidiary SEAT in Spain, has been named to a newly-created management board position for purchasing.   VW names successor to Lopez =2 VW, in a copy of an internal electronic mail sent by Piech to top management, said Rolf Zimmermann, a management board member at VW's Czech subsidary Skoda, will take on group-wide responsibility for logistic operations. Michael Kaltenecker at VW's luxury car unit Audi was also named to be the tools manager for the group. Folker Weissgerber, currently responsible for production and logistics, and will take on group-wide responsibility for production optmisation. Lopez is the target of a German criminal investigation for allegedly stealing secret documents from GM when he joined Volkswagen in March 1993. GM has filed a U.S. civil lawsuit against VW and Lopez, also also other top VW officials, that observers say will seek possibly billions of marks in damages. Lopez's lawyers said he resigned from VW to prepare his defence against criminal charges expected to be filed by year-end by German prosecutors. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Shares in German carmaker Volkswagen fell 5.7 percent to 583.50 marks ($379) in IBIS electronic trade on Monday amid foreign selling, their lowest level since October 23 when they closed at 582.78 marks. Dealers said the rush by foreign investors to sell VW shares was linked to worries about the ongoing legal dispute with U.S. carmaker General Motors Corp. "It's been a catastrophic day for VW shares," one dealer said earlier. On Friday, VW accepted the resignation of production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez, who is at the centre of a legal battle between VW and GM, which gave the stock a slight lift. However, G.M.

83167>>0>> Shares in German carmaker Volkswagen fell over three percent on Monday as dealers cited foreign selling linked to worries about the ongoing legal dispute with U.S. carmaker General Motors Corp. VW shares touched a day's low of 591 marks, the stock's lowest level for over a month, before paring losses slightly to trade down 22.5 marks at 594 marks, by 1055 GMT. The rest of the German market was at record high levels, with the DAX index up 0.45 percent at 2,858.38 points. "It's been a catastrophic day for VW shares," said one dealer. VW on Friday accepted the resignation of production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who is at the centre of a three-year battle between VW and GM, reassuring the market and sending the stock up slightly. But dealers said the Lopez resignation would not necessarily mean the end of the legal battle and fears that VW might still face large possible damages had crept back into the market. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525

83167>>0>> An attorney representing Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua told a judge Tuesday that he plans to file a motion asking for a stay in General Motors Corp's civil suit against Lopez, enabling the former GM executive to concentrate on his criminal defense in an industrial espionage case in Germany. Plato Cacheris, a Washington, D.C.-attorney representing Lopez, said he expects criminal charges to be filed in Germany against Lopez before the end of 1996.   The anticipated criminal charges against Lopez stem from allegations that he stole confidential documents when he left GM and joined Volkswagen AG in 1993. Lopez resigned from Volkswagen last week, saying he wanted to concentrate on his criminal defense and set up his own consulting company. Cacheris' comments came during a scheduling conference in U.S. District Court in Detroit on Tuesday before Judge Nancy Edmunds. Edmunds said at the beginning of the conference that she wanted to dispel notions that a settlement of GM's civil suit against VW and Lopez is near. "This conference is not for the purpose of discussing a settlement," Edmunds told the more than 10 attorneys present.

83167>>0>> A Volkswagen AG attorney predicted Tuesday it will be at least two years before the German automaker goes to trial in the United States to defend itself against corporate spying charges from General Motors Corp. James Denvir, a Washington-based attorney representing VW in the GM civil suit, said VW remained open to settling the matter but there were no talks currently. "They are interested in a settlement that would be fair to both sides," Denvir told reporters following a scheduling conference in federal court before U.S. Distric Judge Nancy Edmunds. GM filed suit in March, alleging its former purchasing chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and several other executives stole confidential parts pricing, product plans and manufacturing documents when they defected to VW in 1993. On Tuesday, a lawyer representing Lopez and three other defendants told Edmunds he planned to file a motion asking that they be temporarily removed from GM's suit so they can concentrate on their defence against likely criminal charges. A hearing on that motion was set for Jan. 29, 1997. Attorney Plato Cacheris said charges against Lopez will likely be filed by German prosecutors before the end of 1996. Lopez resigned his post at VW last week. The other defendants to be included in the motion are Jose Manual Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez and Rosario Piazza. All three men quit GM on March 22, 1993, 12 days after Lopez left. Alvarez and Piazza joined VW's operations in Spain, while Gutierrez went to work for VW in Germany. GM attorney Michael Millikin said after the scheduling conference that he expected Edmunds to deny the motion because it was common for U.S. civil claims to proceed at the same time as criminal cases. "I'm not even contemplating not having all the defendants in this courtroom," he said. Edmunds and lawyers for both sides spent about two hours Tuesday morning hammering out a schedule for the initial phase of fact-finding and depositions by both sides, a process called discovery. Noting media reports the two sides are closing in on an out-of-court settlement, Edmunds told reporters and spectators in the courtroom she wanted to "dispel those notions" that a settlement was near. "This conference is not for the purpose of discussing a settlement," she said. Edmunds told attorneys to complete their first exchange of documents by the end of February, 1997. The documents will include a multi-volumed audit of VW from KPMG Peat Marwick's German branch, and thousands of documents the auditing firm took from VW. Denvir said the number of documents taken by KPMG was so large that VW itself did not know the full extent. VW has said the audit backs up its claims that no confidential GM documents ever got to VW. The first depositions in the case were scheduled to begin March 10 and proceed through May 30. Edmunds set March 6 as the date of the next discovery status conference. Responding to a complaint from VW lawyers that GM's discovery demands were too vague, Edmunds said GM must specify which trade secrets it alleges were stolen. While acknowledging the huge scope of the case, she said, "We're going to move this case along." In Germany meanwhile, the top executive at GM's Adam Opel AG unit demanded Tuesday that VW cut ties with executives linked to its allegations of industrial spying before any settlement can be reached. Opel Chief Executive David Herman told Reuters in an interview that "an opportunity to move forward" was lost when VW accepted the resignation of Lopez but said he might stay on as a consultant. Herman said no settlement talks are currently being held with VW and that none were currently scheduled. Opel has set conditions for a settlement with VW in its U.S. civil court lawsuit -- Lopez and other collaborators must leave VW, a public acknowledgment of error must be issued and VW must pay unspecified damages.
83167>>0>> An attorney representing Volkswagen AG said Tuesday the automaker is not currently discussing a settlement with General Motors Corp to end GM's civil claims against Volkswagen. James Denvir, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney, said the German automaker remains open to a settlement of the industrial spying charges that General Motors filed against it in March in U.S. District Court here. "There are no negotiations going on at this moment," Denvir told reporters following a scheduling conference in federal court.   GM attorney Michael Millikin declined to discuss the possibility of a settlement. "I'm not going to get into settlement discussions at all," he said after the scheduling conference. U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds told both parties they needed to complete the first phase of discovery by the end of February 1997. She said depositions would start in March. Denvir said it could be two years before the start of the trial, which would then take nine months to complete. GM has accused its former purchasing chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and several other former GM executives of stealing confidential documents when they defected to Volkswagen in 1993. Lopez, who faces likely German criminal charges in the case, resigned from Volkswagen last week. Both he and Volkswagen have denied GM's charges. ((-- Chicago newsdesk 312 408-8787))
83167>>0>> Adam Opel AG, saying relations with Volkswagen AG have worsened even more, demanded on Tuesday that VW slash ties with executives linked to its allegations of industrial spying before any settlement can be reached. Opel chief executive David Herman told Reuters in an interview that "an opportunity to move forward" was lost when VW accepted the resignation of VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua but said he might stay on as a consultant. Herman said no settlement talks are currently being held with VW and that none were currently scheduled. "There is no chance right now to go forward," Herman said. Opel, a unit of General Motors Corp, has set conditions for a settlement with VW in its U.S. civil court lawsuit -- Lopez and other collaborators must leave VW, a public acknowledgement of error must be issued and VW must pay damages. "The situation has gotten worse," he said. "We do not accept that Lopez directs any actions on behalf of their company from the outside and that all people that we alleged to be in the conspiracy are still working there and making use of our company information," he said. VW spokesman Klaus Kocks declined to comment on Herman's statements but said VW stood by its commitment to enter any negotiations without any preconditions. "We have always said that we are ready to talk but without any preconditions," Kocks told Reuters. "Right now, we agree to disagree on the general judgment of what happened. The point is that no damage has been done and there will be no money." Opel was incensed that VW has ignored its demand for Lopez and at least seven other former GM executives who followed him to Volkswagen in March 1993 to be forced out for allegedly taking along production and purchasing secret document. Lopez, who announced his resignation on Friday, will receive about four million marks in compensation and VW management board chairman Ferdinand Peich said he would welcome the chance to keep on working with Lopez as a consultant. In addition, one of Lopez's protogees and a former GM employee, Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, 39, who is a defendant in the U.S. lawsuit, has been named to replace Lopez. "That certainly does not satisfy any of the conditions," Opel's Herman said. "It doesn't improve the situation if Lopez continues along the same route from another office. He would still be working for VW and using information stolen from us," Herman said. Herman dismissed speculation that Opel has put a potential jury verdict payout for Volkswagen in the U.S. civil court lawsuit at several billion dollars, saying a decision on what to seek in any jury trial is still under consideration. "We have not yet specified the amount to seek. It is irresponsible for people to stick their finger in the air and say what is a fair assessment," Herman said. "We believe our claims in the U.S. and Germany have a substantial basis. We will win those cases and it could lead to a substantially high amount of damages," he said. "What the right amount will be is something that will come out of a full analysis of the facts, including the results of the discovery phase of the lawsuit," he said. He reaffirmed Opel would consider a deal but prior talks, which he said have not been held for some time, have failed. "There has not even been an agreement on the conditions for a settlement nor discussions at this time," he said. He said one sticking point was getting VW to apologise for statements made by top VW officials at the outset of the fight between the two carmakers, including allegations by German politicans that the United States wanted to start "an economic war" with Germany and that GM and Opel were doing it. Herman noted that GM and Opel -- which are the No. 2 carmakers in Europe behind VW -- were aware how far they could push VW in the legal battle without its public image suffering. "We are conscious of the necessity that whatever happens the parties must be able to live and work together in the German community in the future," Herman said. Herman also dismissed speculation from industry observers that there was a rift between Opel's German headquarters and top GM executives in Detroit on how to proceed with the case. "That is preposterous," he said. "It is not logical and certainly not correct to give the impression that anything we are doing does not represent the studied position of all concerned within our corporation."
83167>>0>> Adam Opel's already strained relations with Volkswagen got worse on Tuesday when it demanded VW cut ties with executives linked to allegations of industrial spying before a settlement of a civil suit launched by its parent, General Motors, can be reached. Opel chief executive David Herman told Reuters in an interview that "an opportunity to move forward" was lost when VW accepted the resignation of VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, but said he might stay on as a consultant.

"What the right amount will be is something that will come out of a full analysis of the facts, including the results of the discovery phase of the lawsuit." He reaffirmed that Opel would consider a deal, but talks, which he said have not been held for some time, have failed. "There has not even been an agreement on the conditions for a settlement, nor discussions at this time," he said.   He said one sticking point was getting VW to apologise for statements made by top VW officials at the outset, including allegations by German politicans that the United States wanted to start "an economic war" with Germany and that GM and Opel were doing it. Herman noted that GM and Opel -- which are the No. 2 carmakers in Europe behind VW -- were aware how far they could push VW in the legal battle without its public image suffering. "We are conscious of the necessity that, whatever happens, the parties must be able to live and work together in the German community in the future," Herman said. Herman also dismissed speculation from industry observers that there was a rift between Opel's German headquarters and top GM executives in Detroit on how to proceed with the case. "That is preposterous," he said. "It is not logical and certainly not correct to give the impression that anything we are doing does not represent the studied position of all concerned within our corporation." --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> General Motors Corp., bolstered by another favorable ruling in its industrial espionage lawsuit against Volkswagen AG, said Monday it was not ready to to settle the high-profile case. U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds on Monday cleared the way for the suit to proceed toward trial by denying Volkswagen's remaining preliminary motions in the case. In the ruling, Edmunds allowed GM to pursue claims that Volkswagen and several of its top executives violated copyright, trademark and unfair competition laws in an alleged scheme to steal GM trade secrets. Last week, Edmunds allowed GM's claims to proceed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -- which could lead to triple damages against VW reaching into the billions of dollars. GM spokesman John Mueller said no settlement talks had taken place on Monday, despite the resignation of VW's production chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, on Friday. GM and its Adam Opel subsidiary in Germany have accused Lopez and other top VW executives of forming a conspiracy to steal GM trade secrets when Lopez and several others abruptly quit GM to join the German automaker in 1993. Mueller said VW also must acknowledge wrongdoing and compensate GM for its damages. "The harm caused to GM and Opel caused by the wrongful conduct of Lopez and his collaborators remains to be remedied," Mueller said Monday. GM officials also said they were astounded at news that VW would meet the obligations of Lopez's contract, paying him about $2.6 million through March 1998. "This is absolutely not sufficient," said one GM executive who asked not to be identified. "Letting him resign and then having top executives praise him and say that they can see him as a top consultant in the future does not meet our requirements." On Tuesday, Edmunds will meet with lawyers from both sides to set a schedule and procedures for discovery, the process of taking sworn statements from witnesses and disclosing other evidence in the case. David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive transportation, said GM would likely let VW squirm for a while as the case proceeds, but will ultimately settle. "I don't think either company wants to go to court," Cole said. "It'll be the corporate equivalent of the O.J. (Simpson) case, with unbelievable media attention." GM has won the early procedural rounds, but none of them have dealt with the merits of its claims. "Her (Edmunds') decision supports our position and clears the way for those allegations to be heard in the upcoming trial along with our RICO claims," Mueller said of Monday's decision. In Germany on Monday, Volkswagen Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech, who also is named as a defendant in the GM suit, took over some of Lopez' responsibilities. An internal memo by Piech to top VW executives dated Monday said Piech has taken over group-wide control of "product optimization and procurement" following the resignation last Friday of Lopez. The management reshuffling at VW included the naming of Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, who followed Lopez to VW from GM, to the VW management board from his current position as a senior executive at VW's Spanish subisidary SEAT. Garcia Sanz will oversee VW purchasing activities, according to the memo obtained by Reuters. VW executive Peter Hartz was also named to take over Lopez's duties with VW's America and Africa units. Piech made the management changes as VW stock fell nearly 6 percent on Monday after GM said it would not let up on its legal battle against the Wolfsburg-based carmaker, Europe's biggest. Volkswagen shares fell 34.50 marks to 582 marks ($375) but pared some of the losses to end bourse trade down 29.50 marks at 587 marks ($378).
83167>>0>> The leader of Volkswagen's Audi luxury car arm has been chosen to lead the German carmaker's Latin American unit following the resignation last week of a controversial VW executive, industry sources said on Tuesday. The sources said Audi management board chairman Herbert Demel has been chosen to succeed VW executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua -- the target of a German criminal probe into industrial spying allegations -- as head of the regional unit. A top Audi management board member, Franz-Josef Paefgen, has been selected to replace Demel as head of the Ingolstadt-based luxury carmaker, the sources said. An Audi spokesman declined comment on the leadership changes at the carmaker but said personnel issues would be a topic of discussion at a Audi supervisory board meeting on Wednesday in the Hungarian city of Gyor. The Audi spokesman also said there could be a decision at the meeting on a possible new Audi factory in Brazil. Audi has long planned a car production plant in the dollar region to better latch on to the U.S. market. Lopez, who had headed the Latin American operations at VW, resigned last Friday to prepare his defence for allegations that he and other former executive at Opel AG stole secret documents when they abruptly quit to join VW in March 1993. He is one of several top VW officials, including VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech, who are named as defendants in a U.S. civil lawsuit filed by GM and its Opel unit that charges the company with industrial spying. VW on Monday said Piech has taken over some of the VW group duties held by Lopez but also promoted a protogee of Lopez -- and also a defendant in a U.S. lawsuit filed by GM against VW -- to the VW management board in charge of purchasing. The official, Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, 39, is one of seven close associates of Lopez who left GM with him to join VW. GM has demanded that Garcia Sanz and the others also leave VW before any discussion of an out-of-court settlement. Several German newspapers have recently reported that Demel, an Austrian who had been in charge at Audi for 2-1/2 years, would give up his position and take up responsibility for Volkswagen's Latin American business. Demel, who was named management board chairman at Audi in February 1994, has been credited with invigorating Audi to shed its drab image in favour of a carmaker that makes award-winning models, such as the A4 saloon that has underpinned its revival. He is also considered by industry analysts to be a top contender to succeed Piech, who was also once chief executive at Audi, in the future as the top official at VW. Paefgen, 50, joined the Audi management board in March 1994 and has been responsible for technical development. He started his career in the car industry as a trainee in 1976 with the German unit of Ford Motor Corp and joined Audi in 1980.
83167>>0>> Shares in German carmaker Volkswagen AG took a hammering in electronic share trade early on Tuesday, but then rose sharply in bourse trade as investors went bargain-hunting for stock in Europe's largest carmaker. The share fell three percent to touch 574 marks -- their lowest level since October 11 -- after a U.S. judge denied VW's motion to dismiss General Motor's remaining industrial espionage charges. However, VW shares then advanced strongly during floor trade and ended bourse trade on Germany's DAX index of blue-chips at 592.50 marks, up 5.50 marks. "We think the chances to buy the stock at this price will be relatively short -- VW shares are cheap at this level and no-one is going to base their investment strategy on one event," said Horst Frey, car analyst at ABN Amro in Frankfurt. One share trader said: "The way the share price has moved today is staggering. Fundamentally the stock is in very good shape. We've been saying that the downside on the share has been overdone looking at the health of the company." The trader sounded a note of caution, however. "We haven't seen one buy order at these lower levels today. This means that it probably isn't the institutions boosting the share -- it could be day-to-day buyers snapping it up, who will then sell it on as the share rises," said the trader. Market players agreed that the outlook for the share price in the next few days depends on whether or not there is a settlement in the legal dispute between Volkswagen and GM. "For VW to appoint Javier Garcia Sanz (a co-defendant in the U.S. civil law suit) to the board is a bit like waving a red rag to a bull. The two are preparing to slug it out, so in the meantime we'll get on with looking at the rest of the company," said a London-based DAX trader. A trader in Frankfurt said: "Watch the reaction on the share price tomorrow. I believe that GM wants Volkswagen to sizzle a little bit more and will not settle soon. "But the share price should still be okay as long as people believe that fundamentally the stock is alright. On the other hand, the stock will only continue to thrive as long as no-one can assess the damages that VW will have to pay out," he said. Other market players were adopting a wait-and-see approach, with one motor analyst saying that the real buying interest will kick in once the stock hits 550 marks. The strength of the dollar against the mark lifted the exporting sector generally, including other German carmakers, and a portion of Volkswagen's rise could be attributed to a general sectoral boost. The initial share price drop came following news from the U.S. late on Monday that U.S. District Judge Nancy Edwards allowed GM to pursue claims that Volkswagen and several of its top executives violated copyright, trademark and unfair competition laws in an alleged scheme to steal GM trade secrets. This cleared the way for the U.S. lawsuit to proceed. A GM spokesman said on Monday that GM had not held settlement talks with VW and was prepared to let the case proceed. The resignation last Friday of VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, at the centre of the allegations, had fuelled speculation that the two could settle their dispute out of court, which boosted the share slightly. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Audi AG, the luxury carmaking unit of German carmaker Volkswagen AG, has decided to name Franz-Josef Paefgen as its new management board chairman, industry sources said on Tuesday. The appointment of Paefgen to lead the Ingolstadt-based carmaker comes after reports on Tuesday that current Audi management board chairman Herbert Demel has been chosen to lead the Latin American business of parent company Volkswagen.   An Audi spokesman declined comment on the leadership change at the carmaker and the transfer of Demel to VW following the resignation last Friday of VW management board member Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. Lopez, who had led the Latin American operations, is the target of a German criminal probe reviewing allegations that he and other former executive at Opel AG stole secret documents when they abruptly quit to join VW in March 1993. Several German newspapers have recently reported that Demel, an Austrian who had been in charge at Audi for 2-1/2 years, would give up his position and take up responsibility for Volkswagen's Latin American business. Paefgen, 50, joined the Audi management board in March 1994 and has been responsible for technical development. He started his career in the car industry as a trainee in 1976 with the German unit of Ford Motor Corp and joined Audi in 1980. Audi confirmed earlier on Tuesday that its supervisory board would meet in the Hungarian town of Gyor on Wednesday and that personnel issues would be discussed at the meeting. The spokesman also said there could be a decision at the meeting on a possible new Audi factory in Brazil. Sources in the motor industry say that the plant would involve hundreds of millions of marks in investments. Audi has long planned a car production plant in the dollar region to better latch on to the U.S. market. In 1995 Audi sold nearly 3,400 vehicles in Latin America, with the main market in Brazil. VW sells around 700,000 vehicles in the dollar region, the Audi spokesman said. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Shares in Volkswagen slipped on Tuesday after a U.S. judge denied the firm's motion to dismiss General Motors Corp's remaining industrial espionage claims against the German carmaker. VW shares tumbled over three percent to touch 574 marks in early electronic IBIS dealings, its lowest level since October 11, when the stock closed bourse dealings at 572.50 marks. The stock later pared losses slightly to stand down nine marks at 584 marks. VW shares were the only DAX stock in negative territory, with the rest of the DAX index of leading shares surging to new highs, boosted by a stronger dollar, up 1.25 percent to 2,889.17 points. Dollar strength gave other German carmakers a boost, with shares in Daimler-Benz AG and BMW AG soaring to new highs. The judge's decision cleared the way for GM's U.S. lawsuit to proceed. A GM spokesman also said on Monday that GM had not held settlement talks with VW and was prepared to let the case proceed. The sacking last Friday of VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, at the centre of the allegations, had fuelled speculation that the two could settle their dispute out of court and gave the share price a slight boost. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525

83167>>0>> Germany said on Wednesday it wanted to discuss a way to solve a fight between General Motors Corp and Volkswagen AG with the United States amid a new report saying GM would seek billions of dollars from its German rival. German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said in Bonn that he would discuss a way to end the bitter legal battle between the two major carmakers with U.S. officials at the World Trade Organisation meeting next week in Singapore. "I will take the topic along to Singapore," Rexrodt told reporters at a briefing about the upcoming WTO meeting from December 7-13 in the Asian city-state. Germany's Stern magazine also reported on Wednesday that GM and its German arm, Adam Opel AG, will demand at least six billion marks ($3.8 billion) in damages from VW in its U.S. lawsuit over allegations of industrial espionage. Stern magazine said the provisional figure was reached by GM and Opel estimating that more than 4,000 pages of secret information with prices for about 110,000 car components were taken by top GM executives who quit in 1993 to join VW. VW has vehemently denied the allegations. If a U.S. jury were to rule in favour of GM and Opel, a U.S. racketeering law being applied to the case would automatically triple any damages, making VW liable to pay under the minimum request almost 20 billion marks. Previous published reports in Germany and the U.S. have put the damages that GM would seek at anywhere from a couple of hundred million dollars to up to $7.5 billion. An Opel spokesman declined comment on the Stern report and Opel chief executive David Herman said on Tuesday the carmaker had not yet specificed what it would seek from VW. "What the right amount will be is something that will come out of a full analysis of the facts, including the results of the discovery phase of the lawsuit," Herman said. Stern said the data at the centre of the case helped VW, Europe's largest carmaker, cut annual costs by about four billion marks, saving the firm about 10 percent of the 40 billion marks it spends each year on parts. GM alleges that its former top purchasing executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, used the information to cut some 700 million marks of costs at Volkswagen and quickly erode the 20 percent cost advantage Opel had over its German rival. Lopez resigned last Friday from the VW management board, with his lawyers saying he did so to prepare his defence for GM's U.S. lawsuit and for expected German criminal charges. A German prosecutor on Wednesday said a decision on whether to file criminal charges against Lopez and at least four of his associates who followed him to VW from GM would be made some time in mid-December. Herbert Spohn, a spokesman for the Darmstadt public prosecutors' office near Frankfurt, said prosecutors would hold a news conference sometime in mid-December to announce their decision on whether to file any criminal charges. Lopez's German lawyer had said he expects the criminal charges to be filed against his client by the end of November. Lopez and other top VW executives, including VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech, have been named as defendants in the U.S. lawsuit that alleges VW officials conspired to get the information as Lopez and seven other executives left GM. Herman reaffirmed that Opel would consider an out-of-court deal but added that prior talks, which he said had not been held for some time, had failed. Stern said the last round of talks were held in London in September between VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen and GM executive committee chairman John Smale with no success. The magazine also said GM's investigation of the data allegedly taken by Lopez and his associates focuses on a new VW plant in Brazil where vans are built. Stern said German public prosecutors had found the original plans in VW computers for the plant that were developed by Lopez while still at GM. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> General Motors Corp. will demand at least 6 billion marks ($3.8 billion) in damages from rival Volkswagen AG in its U.S. lawsuit over allegations of industrial espionage, a magazine report said Wednesday. Germany's Stern magazine said the provisional figure was reached by GM estimating that more than 4,000 pages of secret information with prices for about 110,000 car components were taken by top GM executives who quit in 1993 to join VW. VW has vehemently denied the allegations. If a U.S. jury were to rule in favour of GM and its German subsidiary Opel, a U.S. racketeering law being applied to the case would automatically triple any damages. In Detroit, GM spokesman John Mueller said the automaker had not quantified any potential amounts because it did not know the extent of the alleged damages. "We have from the outset not put a figure on that because the number will be developed during the course of the trial." "We expect that amount to be substantial." Previous published reports have put the damages that GM would seek at anywhere from a couple of hundred million dollars to up to $7.5 billion. An Opel spokesman declined comment on the Stern report. Opel Chief Executive David Herman told Reuters Tuesday that the carmaker had not yet specified what it would seek from VW. "What the right amount will be is something that will come out of a full analysis of the facts, including the results of the discovery phase of the lawsuit," Herman told Reuters. Stern said the data at the centre of the case helped VW, Europe's largest carmaker, cut annual costs by about four billion marks ($2.6 billion), saving the carmaker about 10 percent of the 40 billion marks ($25.6 billion) it spends each year on parts. GM alleges that its former top purchasing executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, used the information to cut some 700 million marks ($448.2 million) of purchases at Volkswagen and quickly erode the 20 percent cost advantage Opel had over its German rival. "We have never charged that VW does not build good cars but that they had a cost problem and they solved that problem with our information," Stern quoted a GM official as saying. Lopez resigned last Friday from the VW management board, with his lawyers saying he did so to prepare his defence. Lopez and other top VW executives, including VW management board Chairman Ferdinand Piech, have been named as defendants in the U.S. lawsuit that alleges VW officials conspired to get the information as Lopez and seven other executives left GM. Herbert Spohn, a spokesman for the Darmstadt public prosecutors' office near Frankfurt, told Reuters that no decision on whether to file charges against Lopez would be made this week but may come later this month.
83167>>0>> German carmaker Audi AG said on Wednesday its chief executive would leave to head the Latin American arm of parent Volkswagen in the latest management change after a VW executive tied to a spying scandal resigned. Herbert Demel, chairman of Audi since February 1994, has been chosen to be president of Volkswagen's Latin American arm based in Brazil, which industry analysts say could put Demel in contention to be a future VW chairman. Audi said Demel will be replaced by Audi management board member Franz-Josef Paefgen as leader of the Ingolstadt-based carmaker when the transition takes place in mid-1997. Paefgen, 50, joined the Audi management board in March 1994 and has been responsible for technical development. He started his career in the German car industry as a trainee in 1976 with the German arm of Ford Motor Corp and joined Audi in 1980. Industry sources confirmed on Tuesday the anticipated management changes among the foreign arms of VW, which include Spain's SEAT and Skoda in the Czech Republic. Demel, 43, had been tipped to lead the VW regional group after the current leader of VW's Latin American operations, Pierre-Alain de Smedt, was selected to be chairman of SEAT. De Smedt, a Belgian, was named in October to head SEAT after outgoing chairman Juan Llorens was believed by observers to have lost the confidence of Piech after ongoing losses. VW said Demel's move was not related to the resignation last Friday of VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who was also chairman of VW's Latin American arm. VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech will take on Lopez's job title in Brazil, which is the largest foreign unit operated by VW with 10 billion marks ($6.4 billion) in yearly sales. But industry officials noted that Lopez, a Spaniard, had long been seen as a top candidate to take over SEAT, eliminating the need for Demel and de Smedt to be transferred. Lopez is one of several top VW officials, including Piech, who are defendants in a U.S. civil lawsuit filed by U.S. carmaker General Motors Corp and its German unit Opel that allege VW committed industrial spying when Lopez and seven associates left GM in 1993 to join VW. Lopez, according to his lawyers, quit his VW position to prepare his defence to allegations in the U.S. lawsuit as well as those expected in German criminal charges. VW has vehemently denied the charges of industrial spying. Audi said the decision, which calls for Demel to start his duties at the Latin American unit in January while also in control of Audi, was made by its supervisory board at a meeting in Hungary where the carmaker has a new production facility. Demel has been credited with invigorating Audi, which has shed its drab image and now that turns out award-winning models, like the A4 saloon. "He has been an outstanding leader that has put Audi back on a track to profitability and has overseen the development of a number of new profitable and exciting models," one industry official who asked not be named said about Demel. Although Audi has higher annual revenues than the Brazil unit, Demel is seen by industry analysts to be a top contender to succeed Piech, who was also once chief executive at Audi. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525 ($1=1.5599 Mark)
83167>>0>> A German public prosecutor said on Thursday that a decision on whether to file criminal charges against a former Volkswagen AG executive on industrial spying allegations will be made some time in mid-December. Herbert Spohn, a spokesman for the Darmstadt public prosecutors' office near Frankfurt, told Reuters that no decision on whether to file charges against Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua would be made this week. But he said prosecutors would hold a news conference "sometime in mid-December" to announce their decision following a three and a half year probe of allegations by rival Adam Opel AG that Lopez and four other associates stole industrial secrets when they left Opel in 1993 for VW. Lopez's German lawyer had said he expects the criminal charges to be filed against his client by the end of November. Opel and its parent company, U.S.-based General Motors Corp, have also filed a civil lawsuit in the U.S. against Lopez and some top VW executives under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO). VW and Lopez have denied the charges. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

83167>>0>> German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said on Wednesday he would discuss with U.S. officials at the World Trade Organisation meeting the legal fight between Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp over industrial spying charges. "I will take along the topic to Singapore," Rexrodt told reporters at a briefing about the upcoming WTO meeting from December 7-13.   Rexrodt to discuss GM-VW fight with U.S. at WTO Rexrodt said "an acceptable solution" must be found for both sides in the fight over GM's allegations that a group of top GM officials took along secret documents when they abruptly quit the U.S. carmaker in March 1993 to join Volkswagen. But he declined to say which company was right in the dispute, which has VW facing a racketeering lawsuit in the U.S. filed by GM and its German subsidiary Adam Opel AG. He noted that he has spoken often with both sides in recent years. GM has alleged that former GM purchasing executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and seven of his associates stole secret documents that have since helped VW cut operating costs. Lopez, whose lawyers say he will face criminal charges in Germany related to the documents, resigned from VW last Friday. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> German luxury carmaker Audi AG, a unit of Volkswagen AG, said on Wednesday that Audi chief executive Herbert Demel has been chosen to lead the Brazil unit of VW from mid-1997. The carmaker also said that Audi management board member Franz-Josef Paefgen has been selected to replace Demel as head of the Ingolstadt-based luxury carmaker. Industry sources had confirmed the management changes at Audi on Tuesday.   The decision was made by Audi's supervisory board in the Hungarian city of Gyor, where the Ingolstadt-based carmaker has a new production facility. Demel has been chosen to lead the VW's Latin American unit following the resignation last week of VW executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who faces allegations of industrial spying in a U.S. civil court lawsuit and also in Germany. Lopez resigned last Friday to prepare his defence for allegations that he and a group of former executive at Opel AG and parent company General Motors Corp stole secret documents when they abruptly quit to join VW in March 1993. Several German newspapers have recently reported that Demel, an Austrian who had been in charge at Audi for 2-1/2 years, would give up his position and take up responsibility for Volkswagen's Latin American business. Demel, who was named management board chairman at Audi in February 1994, has been credited with invigorating Audi to shed its drab image in favour of a carmaker that makes award-winning models, such as the A4 saloon that has underpinned its revival. He is also considered by industry analysts to be a top contender to succeed Piech, who was also once chief executive at Audi, in the future as the top official at VW. Paefgen, 50, joined the Audi management board in March 1994 and has been responsible for technical development. He started his career in the car industry as a trainee in 1976 with the German unit of Ford Motor Corp and joined Audi in 1980. Lopez is one of several top VW officials, including VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech, who are named as defendants in a U.S. civil lawsuit filed by GM and Opel that allege the company committed industrial spying. VW on Monday said Piech has taken over some of the VW group duties held by Lopez but also promoted a protogee of Lopez -- and also a defendant in a U.S. lawsuit filed by GM against VW -- to the VW management board in charge of purchasing. The official, Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, 39, is one of seven close associates of Lopez who left GM with him to join VW. GM has demanded that Garcia Sanz and the others also leave VW before any discussion of an out-of-court settlement. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> General Motors will demand at least six billion marks ($3.8 billion) in damages from rival Volkswagen in its U.S. lawsuit over allegations of industrial espionage, a magazine report said on Wednesday. Germany's Stern magazine said the provisional figure was reached by GM estimating that more than 4,000 pages of secret information with prices for about 110,000 car components were taken by top GM executives who quit in 1993 to join VW. VW has vehemently denied the allegations. If a U.S. jury were to rule in favour of GM and its German subsidiary Opel, a U.S. racketeering law being applied to the case would automatically triple any damages, making VW liable to pay almost 20 billion marks. Meanwhile, German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said on Wednesday he would discuss the damaging legal fight between VW and GM with U.S. officials at a coming World Trade Organisation meeting. "I will take along the topic to Singapore," Rexrodt told reporters in Bonn at a briefing about the upcoming WTO meeting being held from December 7-13. Rexrodt said "an acceptable solution" must be found for both sides. Previous published reports have put the damages that GM would seek at anywhere from a couple of hundred million dollars to up to $7.5 billion. An Opel spokesman declined comment on the Stern report and Opel chief executive David Herman told Reuters on Tuesday that the carmaker had not yet specificed what it would seek from VW. "What the right amount will be is something that will come out of a full analysis of the facts, including the results of the discovery phase of the lawsuit," Herman told Reuters. Stern said the data at the centre of the case helped VW, Europe's largest carmaker, cut annual costs by about four billion marks, saving the carmaker about 10 percent of the 40 billion marks it spends each year on parts. GM alleges that its former top purchasing executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, used the information to cut some 700 million marks of purchases at Volkswagen and quickly erode the 20 percent cost advantage Opel had over its German rival. Lopez resigned last Friday from the VW management board, with his lawyers saying he did so to prepare his defence. ($1=1.5599 Mark)
83167>>0>> General Motors Corp will demand at least six billion marks ($3.8 billion) in damages from rival Volkswagen AG in its U.S. lawsuit over allegations of industrial espionage, a magazine report said on Wednesday. Germany's Stern magazine said the provisional figure was reached by GM estimating that more than 4,000 pages of secret information with prices for about 110,000 car components were taken by top GM executives who quit in 1993 to join VW.

GM alleges that its former top purchasing executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, used the information to cut some 700 million marks of purchases at Volkswagen and quickly erode the 20 percent cost advantage Opel had over its German rival. Lopez resigned last Friday from the VW management board, with his lawyers saying he did so to prepare his defence. "We have never charged that VW does not build good cars but that they had a cost problem and they solved that problem with our information," Stern quoted a GM official as saying. Lopez and other top VW executives, including VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech, have been named as defendants in the U.S. lawsuit that alleges VW officials conspired to get the information as Lopez and seven other executives left GM. Herman reaffirmed that Opel would consider an out-of-court deal but added that prior talks, which he said have not been held for some time, had failed. Stern said the last round of talks were held in London in September between VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen and GM executive committee chairman John Smale with no success. The magazine also said GM's investigation of the data allegedly taken by Lopez and his associates focuses on a new VW plant in Brazil where vans are built. Stern said the German public prosecutors' office, which has been investigating the allegations of industrial spying for nearly four years, has found the original plans in VW computers for the plant that were developed by Lopez while still at GM.

83167>>0>> General Motors Corp and its Adam Opel AG German subsidiary issued a statement Thursday reiterating that Volkwsagen AG needs to meet certain conditions before GM will settle industrial espionage claims. GM has demanded that VW acknowledge wrongful conduct occurred and sever its ties with Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former GM purchasing executive who allegedly stole secret files when he defected to VW in 1993.   GM has also demanded that VW compensate it with a "substantial" financial payment for damages allegedly suffered as a result of actions taken by Lopez and the several other former GM executives who followed him to VW. "These steps do not threaten, and are not meant to cause any threat to, the jobs of innocent Volkswagen employees, but do begin to address the negative effects the wrongful conduct has had on the employees of Opel," GM said in its statement. GM also said it "regrets" that attorneys representing Lopez and three other defendants want to delay GM's civil suit against them in U.S. District Court in Detroit.   On Tuesday, an attorney representing Lopez and the other three said he plans to request a stay in GM's case against the four. That motion is expected to be filed December 13. The lawyer, Plato Cacheris, also said he will seek to keep Lopez and the three others from being forced to give depositions, or sworn statements, in the U.S. Lopez' attorneys have said they expect German prosecutors to bring criminal charges against him before the end of the year. They argue he should not be forced to defend himself against both the expected German criminal and GM civil charges at the same time.

83167>>0>> Egyptian state security prosecutors will charge two Israeli-Arab women in connection with the case of an Israeli and an Egyptian suspected of spying for the Jewish state, state security sources said on Thursday. The sources named the two female Israeli nationals as Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna and said they were not in Egypt and so would be charged in absentia. They were accused of recruiting Egyptian national Emad Eddin Abdel Hamid to spy for Israel's intelligence service Mossad, the sources added. Officials at the Israeli embassy in Cairo were not available for comment. Azam Azam, an Israeli of Arab origin, is also implicated in the case. The sources said Egyptian state security would issue an official charge sheet detailing accusations against the two men and two women on Saturday. Azam, 35, chief mechanic at an Israeli-owned textile factory in Egypt, was arrested in Cairo in November by security authorities along with Hamid. Egyptian security sources have said Hamid confessed to spying for Israel and receiving espionage equipment. Israel has insisted Azam, of Arab origin, was innocent and demanded his release. Egypt in 1979 became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel but ties have cooled sharply since right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June.

83167>>0>> German carmaker Volkswagen AG on Friday rejected demands by rival General Motors Corp for it to further distance itself from a former top VW executive at the centre of industrial spying allegations. The executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, quit his post as the production chief at the German carmaker but may still work for VW as a consultant. VW has also pledged to honour his contract until March 1998 and pay him four million marks ($2.61 million). GM officials have also been irritated that VW's successor to Lopez, Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, 39, is also a former GM official who followed Lopez to VW in March 1993 and is a defendant in a U.S. racketeering lawsuit filed by GM. VW said adamantly it had not acted illegally and sources at the carmaker said the firm would not cave into GM's demands, which stem from the U.S. companies allegations that Lopez took secret documents when he moved VW. The sources said VW would wait for a decision on whether formal charges would be filed against Lopez on the allegations. "There is a cultural difference in that GM thinks it can put political pressure on Volkswagen and expect that we will cave in," a VW official said. Shares in VW, which have recently been under stiff selling pressure amid concerns that it potentially faces a heavy payout in the U.S. lawsuit, fell about three percent in bourse trade to end at 584.50 marks, less than a dramatic four percent drop in Germany's 30-share DAX index. But the impact of the legal battle on VW was evident in a survey by the Forsa Institute which showed 43 percent of Germans were convinced VW's image had suffered as a result of the GM accusations. The survey of 1,000 Germans on December 4-5 also showed that 35 percent feared VW's sales would fall and one-third expected VW, one of Germany's largest employers with about 100,000 workers in Germany, to lose jobs as a result. But the survey also showed one in five Germans did not believe the legal fight would have an impact on the carmaker. GM and its German arm, Adam Opel AG, said on Friday that VW needed to take "fundamental steps" if any deal were to be reached in a U.S. civil court lawsuit GM brought against Lopez and VW leaders on racketeering charges that uses laws initially designed to fight the mafia. The U.S. auto giant also reaffirmed that VW must also publically acknowledge that Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, had acted wrongly in taking the documents and that the VW must sever relations with him and seven other former GM employees who followed him to the Wolfsburg-based carmaker. Lopez's lawyer has said he expects criminal charges to be filed against his client by the end of the year. Prosecutor officials say a decision on any charges is expected next week. GM also criticised the request of an attorney representing Lopez in the U.S. for seeking a stay in GM's civil lawsuit. "GM and Opel continue to seek a judicial determination of the truth as expeditiously as possible in the VW/Lopez case, and believe that the appropriate forum to argue the facts and evidence is in courts of law," GM said in a statement. VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said VW officials who are named as defendants in the lawsuit, including VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech and VW management board member Jens Neumann, would agree to testify in any court hearings. "There have been reports in Detroit newspapers that all Volkswagen officials would plead the Fifth Amendment and agree to take their right not to incriminate themselves," Kocks said. "I cannot speak for Mr. Lopez, but as far as Volkswagen is concerned, all top executives who are involved will go to court, including in Detroit," Kocks said. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525 ($1=1.5338 Mark)

83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG on Friday rejected a demand by General Motors to take immediate action to distance itself further from former purchasing manager Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. Volkswagen spoksman Klaus Kocks told Reuters that VW was still waiting for clarification on whether charges will be filed against Lopez on allegations he stole secret documents from GM in 1993 when he left the company to join VW. The comment came after GM and its German unit Adam Opel AG earlier said VW needed to take "fundamental steps" if any out of court settlement is to be reached in a civil action that GM has brought. GM said that such steps included acknowledgment by VW that Lopez had acted wrongly while working for VW and that the car maker should sever business relations with him and other executives who left GM to join VW. "These steps do not threaten, and are not meant to cause any threat to, the jobs of innocent Volkswagen employees, but do begin to address the negative effects the wrongful conduct has had on the employees of Opel," GM said in a statement. VW said it is still waiting for a decision on whether charges will be filed from the public prosecutor's office in Darmstadt, near Frankfurt. GM also criticised the request of an attorney representing Lopez in the U.S. for a stay in GM's civil suit. "GM and Opel continue to seek a judicial determination of the truth as expeditiously as possible in the VW/Lopez case, and believe that the appropriate forum to argue the facts and evidence is in courts of law," GM said in a statement. But Kocks also said that VW officials named as defendants in a U.S. civil court law suit filed by GM against VW would agree to testify in any future court hearings. "There have been reports in Detroit newspapers that all Volkswagen officials would plead the Fifth Amendment and agree to take their right not to incriminate themselves," Kocks said. He added: "I cannot speak for Mr. Lopez but as far as Volkswagen is concerned all top executives will go to court, including in Detroit." Kocks said. The anticipated criminal charges against Lopez stem from allegations that he stole confidential documents when he left GM and joined VW in 1993. Lopez resigned from the German car maker, Europe's largest, last week, saying he wanted to concentrate on his criminal defence and set up a consulting company. But he may remain in contact with the company as a consultant. --Scott Miller, Frankfurt Newsroom + 49 69 756525

83167>>0>> German carmaker Volkswagen AG said on Friday that legal authorities must decide if its former purchasing manager Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua acted legally.   A Volkswagen spoksman, Klaus Kocks, told Reuters that VW was waiting for a decision from the Darmstadt public prosecutor's office on whether charges will be filed against Lopez on allegations he stole secret documents from General Motors Corp in 1993 when he left the company to join VW. Kocks also said that VW officials named as defendants in a U.S. civil court law suit filed by GM against VW would agree to testify in any future court hearings. "There have been reports in Detroit newspapers that all Volkswagen officials would plead the Fifth Amendment and agree to take their right not to incriminate themselves," Kocks said. He added "I can not speak for Mr. Lopez but as far as Volkswagen is concerned all top executives will go to court, including in Detroit." Kocks said. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG (VW) will seek Chancellor Helmut Kohl's help in trying to settle a dispute with General Motors over charges that the German carmaker stole secrets, senior VW officials told Spiegel magazine. The weekly news magazine, made available ahead of Monday's edition, said VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech and supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen would approach Kohl in early January to request his mediation in the three-year-long conflict. Spiegel quoted another supervisory board member, politician Otto Graff Lambsdorff, calling for Kohl's intervention. "Helmut Kohl must speak with (U.S. President) Bill Clinton," the Free Democrat told Spiegel. GM is seeking huge damages under U.S. anti-racketeering laws over the alleged theft of secret data by Spanish purchasing boss Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who moved from GM's German unit Adam Opel AG to VW in 1993. Lopez resigned from VW last week but has been invited by Piech to stay on as a consultant and his contract will be honoured through to 1998. That has not been enough to satisfy the Detroit car giant's demand for a complete severance of ties, a full apology, acceptance of responsibility for the damage to GM's business and the payment of out-of-court compensation. Walter Leisler Kiep, another member of VW's supervisory board who initiated secret talks with GM in September on ending the dispute, told Bild am Sonntag newspaper there were "realistic chances of an amicable agreement". Kiep rejected the renewed demands by GM as "completely unacceptable". He added that neither side had any interest in a legal battle which could run for years and "could escalate into a battle of unimaginable proportions exceeding all the bounds of competition. "It could result in German-American relations suffering long-term damage, because both companies are national symbols". The head of competing German carmaker Mercedes, Helmut Werner, told Hannoversche Allgemeine newspaper the VW-GM row was "good neither for German industry nor for German-U.S. relations." He added there were good chances that VW's Piech would be able "to clear up the situation". Mercedes is a unit of Daimler-Benz AG. Kiep, a former senior official in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrat party (CDU) and ex-finance minister in Lower Saxony state -- where VW is based -- said he hoped to broker a further meeting between executives of the two companies. He added that the meeting would depend on when German prosecutors open criminal proceedings in a separate case against Lopez over the industrial espionage allegations. That could happen as early as next week, he told Bild am Sonntag. Separately, Focus magazine quoted legal experts as saying that if VW has to pay compensation to GM over the espionage claims, the board could also be liable to the company's lenders and shareholders. Focus quoted the experts as saying that under German law the VW board could be liable for damages if management "grievously violated the duty of care of an honest and conscientious executive". The experts did not agree whether shareholders could seek compensation if the value of their VW stock fell as a result of the GM action.
83167>>0>> Embattled German carmaker Volkswagen (VW) still hopes it can reach a friendly settlement with General Motors over allegations it stole industrial secrets, a senior VW official said on Saturday. Walter Leisler Kiep, a member of VW's supervisory board who initiated closed-door talks with GM in September on ending the three-year-long dispute, told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper there were "realistic chances of an amicable agreement". GM is seeking massive compensation in a U.S. civil suit over the alleged stealing of confidential data by Spanish purchasing boss Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who moved from GM's German unit Adam Opel to VW in 1993. Lopez resigned from VW last week, but has been invited by chief executive Ferdinand Piech to stay on as a consultant and his contract will be honoured through to 1998. That has not been enough to satisfy the Detroit car giant's demand for a complete severance of ties, a full apology, acceptance of responsibility by VW for the damage to GM's business and the payment of compensation. Kiep, speaking to Bild am Sonntag in an interview to be published on Sunday, rejected the renewed demands by GM as "completely unacceptable". He added that neither side had any interest in a legal battle which could stretch on for three or four years and which "could escalate into a battle of unimaginable proportions which exceeds all the bounds of competition. "It could result in German-American relations suffering long-term damage, because both companies are national symbols". The head of competing German carmaker Mercedes, Helmut Werner, said on Saturday the VW-GM row was already hitting bilateral relations and damaging German industry. "The row between VW and General Motors is neither good for German industry nor for German-American relations," Werner told Saturday's edition of the newspaper.

83167>>0>> Venezuela's national telephone company CANTV said Monday a temporary technical problem had caused severe congestion on international calls. "One of the two fiber optic rings that link Venezuela with the rest of the world is temporarily out of service, leading to unusual congestion on international communications," CANTV said in a release. The company added that full service was expected to be progressively restored during Tuesday. CANTV is run by a GTE Corp- led group, which bought a 40 percent stake in the company in 1991. The Venezuelan government recently sold most of its remaining 49 percent in the company through a global share issue. -- Caracas newsroom, 582 505 2600
83167>>0>> Germany's Volkswagen apologised Monday to General Motors Corp. to try to make amends for "trouble and costs" over an industrial espionage scandal, but the giant U.S. automaker said it was not enough. VW Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech said fresh talks now with GM could end a nearly four-year legal battle, pitting two of the world's giant carmakers. Piech told journalists at a Volkswagen AG event in the French-German border city of Colmar, France, that VW may consider resuming purchase of parts from General Motors and its German subsidiary, Adam Opel AG. He expressed regret for the "turmoil, trouble and costs resulting for both companies" over production guru Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua's transfer to the German automaker. But he said the transfer of Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, to VW was "fully legal" and did not comment directly on allegations Lopez and seven other former GM associates stole secret documents when they quit the U.S. automaker. A GM official said Piech's comments were insufficient to bring about new settlement talks saying that the German automaker had to admit to wrongdoing. "It does not meet our conditions," the GM official said. "Our conditions are that VW acknowledge the wrongdoing, sever all ties with Lopez and his collaborators and compensate GM and Opel for the damages. Regret alone will not be sufficient." GM alleged that Lopez used the secret information from GM to cut some 700 million marks ($451 million) of costs at VW, quickly eroding a 20 percent cost advantage that Opel had over its German rival. Piech, the grandson of VW founder Ferdinand Porsche, had long said he would not apologise to GM over its allegations that VW lured away Lopez and others who brought along secret plans on auto parts pricing and an innovative factory. But Piech's statement appeared aimed at meeting one of the conditions that GM has laid out before it would consider any deal to end its U.S. lawsuit accusing VW of racketeering. GM officials have said VW has missed previous chances to de-escalate the fight, including the resignation of Lopez and attempts to strike a new concilatory tone with GM. Signs of progress in the dispute appeared in late November when Lopez quit the VW management board. But Lopez was replaced by Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, 39, who is named as a defendant in the U.S. racketeering lawsuit that also lists Piech and other top VW executives as defendants. Piech also said at the time he would welcome the chance to keep working with Lopez as a consultant, which irked GM officials. VW also agreed to pay Lopez 4 million marks ($2.6 million) for the balance of his contract through March 1998. But Piech said he believed new talks to settle the lawsuit could resume after German prosecutors file criminal charges against Lopez, possibly this week. Lopez's German lawyer has said he expected prosecutors in the suburban Frankfurt city of Darmstadt to file the charges against his client by year-end. Sources have said charges against Lopez will probably be made public in the coming days. In addition, Piech said the last remaining demand by GM -- that VW pay damages for the theft of documents, including pricing data on some 110,000 parts -- was not a primary issue. "The demand for damages was for both sides so far in all talks the least important point," Piech said. He said one part of the negotiations, which were last held secretly in London in September, could be VW agreeing to buy parts from GM or its subsidiaries. Piech said business relations with GM had been dormant for three years. Before that, Piech said VW bought up to 100 million marks ($64 million) of GM parts a year before the Lopez transfer. VW has sought a more conciliatory tone since losing a series of legal fights in the United States exposing it to billions of dollars in potential losses under U.S. racketeering law, which calls for damages to be tripled.
83167>>0>> Germany's Volkswagen apologised on Monday to General Motors to try to make amends for "trouble and costs" over an industrial espionage scandal, but the giant U.S. car maker said it was not enough. VW's chief executive, Ferdinand Piech said fresh talks now with GM could end a nearly four-year legal battle, pitting two of the world's giant carmakers. Piech told journalists at a Volkswagen AG event in the French-German border city of Colmar that VW may consider resuming purchase of parts from General Motors Corp and its German subsidiary, Adam Opel AG. He expressed regret for the "turmoil, trouble and costs resulting for both companies" over production guru, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua's transfer to the German automaker. But he said the transfer of Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, to VW was "fully legal" and did not comment directly on allegations Lopez and seven other former GM associates stole secret documents when they quit the U.S. automaker. A GM official said Piech's comments were insufficient to bring about new settlement talks saying that the German carmaker had to admit to wrongdoing. "It does not meet our conditions," the GM official said. "Our conditions are that VW acknowledge the wrongdoing, sever all ties with Lopez and his collaborators and compensate GM and Opel for the damages. Regret alone will not be sufficient." GM alleges that Lopez used the secret information from GM to cut some 700 million marks ($450.9 million) of costs at VW, quickly eroding a 20 percent cost advantage that Opel had over its German rival.

83167>>0>> Volkswagen's Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech did an about-face Monday, saying he regretted the trouble and costs suffered by General Motors Corp. over the 1993 transfer of a top GM executive to VW who now faces allegations of industrial spying. Piech told journalists at a VW event in the French-German border city of Colmar that he regretted the "turmoil, trouble and costs resulting for both companies" over the transfer to VW from GM of production guru Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. He also believed new talks could be scheduled to end the fight between the two automakers that is nearly four years old and said VW might consider resuming buying parts from GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG.

But Piech's statement appeared aimed at meeting one of the strict conditions that GM has laid out before it would consider any deal to drop its U.S. lawsuit accusing VW of racketeering. The statement also was seen as an attempt to strike a new concilatory tone with GM. In addition to severing ties with Lopez and his associates who left GM for Volkswagen, the Detroit automaker has demanded since 1993 that VW issue a public apology and pay for damages. It was unclear whether GM would accept Piech's statement as being sufficient, especially since GM officials said VW had missed a chance to de-escalate the dispute after Lopez quit. Signs of progress in the dispute appeared in late November when Lopez resigned from the VW management board. But Lopez was replaced by Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz, 39, who is named as a defendant in the U.S. racketeering lawsuit, which also lists Piech and other top VW executives as defendants.

Sources have said the charges would likely be made public in the coming days. In addition, Piech said the last remaining demand by GM -- that VW pay damages for the alleged theft of documents, including pricing data on some 110,000 parts that reduced GM's price advantage in Europe -- was not a primary issue. "The demand for damages was for both sides so far in all talks the least important point," Piech said.

83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech said Monday he regretted the trouble, costs and confusion to General Motors Corp. over the March 1993 transfer of some GM executives to VW who now face allegations of industrial spying. Piech also told journalists at a VW event in Colmar, Germany, that the transfer of the executive at the centre of the dispute, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, to VW was legal. He also said talks to settle a U.S. civil lawsuit filed by GM in Detroit alleging VW and its top executives with racketeering would likely resume after German prosecutors file charges in the coming weeks against Lopez. In addition, Piech said payment for damages was the least important point in prior settlement talks with GM. VW said earlier Monday that Piech would express his "deepest regrets" to GM in an interview to be published Thursday in Germany's mass-circulation Stern magazine. Piech's comments appear to be an attempt to de-escalate the tension with GM and its German subsidiary, Adam Opel AG, regarding allegations that Lopez and seven other GM executives who followed him to VW took along thousands of secret documents. GM has laid out three conditions to VW before it would consider any deal on its U.S. lawsuit -- which could leave VW facing a ruling worth billions of dollars  -- that VW sever all ties with Lopez, issue an apology and pay for damages. Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, resigned from VW in late November, but Piech has said he would be happy to work with Lopez as a consultant. In addition, VW has agreed to pay him 4 million marks ($2.6 million) for the balance of his contract, which has incensed GM executives.
83167>>0>> A top executive at General Motors Corp said on Monday that comments by VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech expressing regret about the turmoil and trouble between the two companies were insufficient for any new talks on settling a U.S. lawsuit alleging racketeering. "Piech's statements are insufficent and cannot be taken seriously," the GM official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters in Frankfurt.   He said VW must admit to wrongdoing over the issue involving former VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and said no settlement talks over the U.S. civil lawsuit were currently planned. Piech earlier on Monday said he regretted the trouble and costs suffered by GM over the 1993 transfer of a top GM executive to VW who now faces allegations of industrial spying. Piech told journalists at a VW event in the French-German border city of Colmar that he regretted the "turmoil, trouble and costs resulting for both companies" over the transfer to VW from GM of production guru Lopez to the Wolfsburg carmaker.   He also believed new talks could be set to end the fight that is nearly four years old and that VW may consider resuming buying parts from GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG.

"It does not meet our conditions," the GM official said. "Our conditions are that VW acknowledge the wrongdoing, sever all ties with Lopez and his collaborators and compensate GM and Opel for the damages." "Regret alone will not be sufficient," the source said. "Piech has expressed regret for confusion and aggravation. What we are interested in having done, is wrongdoings being righted. The place to do that is in the courts of law by moving the case to trial as soon as possible," the source said. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG chief executive Ferdinand Piech said on Monday his company could resume buying car components like wiring and batteries from rival General Motors Corp. Piech told a news conference business relations between the two companies had been "dormant" since 1993, when a legal battle erupted between the two over alleged industrial espionage. Before 1993, VW had bought up to 100 million marks ($64 million) worth of parts from GM each year. Piech said future purchases could be higher but added that the deals would not run into billions. GM alleges that Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who resigned as VW production chief last month, stole industrial secrets when he moved to VW from GM in 1993.

VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said that Piech, in an interview in the Thursday edition of the German magazine Stern, would express "deepest regret" over allegations that former VW purchasing chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua stole documents when he left GM in 1993 to join VW. GM, which has filed a lawsuit against VW in federal court in Detroit over the alleged corporate espionage, has set three conditions before it will consider any out-of-court settlement -- the resignation of Lopez, a public apology from VW and payment for damages. Lopez resigned from VW under pressure late last month after German prosecutors said they would announce by year-end whether he faces criminal charges. Lopez's lawyer has said that he expects charges to be filed against Lopez. A GM spokesman in Germany declined to comment on the report. VW could face penalties totalling billions of dollars in the suit brought by GM, which is based in part on the federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organisations statutes.

GM has set as conditions for it to discuss any lawsuit settlement that VW sever all ties with the executive at the centre of the legal battle, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, as well as issue a public explanation for its actions.

83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG management board chairman Ferdinand Piech will express his "deepest regrets" to General Motors Corp about allegations that a former VW executive stole industrial secrets, a newspaper said on Monday. Germany's Die Welt said in a statement ahead of publication on Tuesday that VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said that Piech would make the statement on Thursday. A VW spokesman was not immediately available for comment on the newspaper report.   VW head to express regret to GM - paper The statement by Die Welt did not say what Piech would exactly say to GM and its German subsidary, Adam Opel AG, nor how the statement would be issued to the U.S. carmaker. GM and Opel have alleged that former VW purchasing executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua stole thousands of secret documents when and some associates abruptly quit GM in March 1993 to join VW, which is Europe's largest carmaker. GM had set down as a condition that VW publicly apologise before any progress could be made in seeking an out-of-court settlement to a U.S. civil court lawsuit filed by GM against VW that charges the Wolfsburg-based carmaker with racketeering. The other conditions included that VW sever all contact with Lopez and other former GM executives now at VW who are named in the U.S. lawsuit as well as payment for damages. The newspaper also said German prosecutors will detail on Friday criminal charges filed against Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard who resigned from VW in November. A spokeswoman for the Frankfurt prosecutors' office has said a decision on any charges against Lopez would be made by the end of December. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

83167>>0>> A reassuring overnight rebound on Wall Street, steady Bunds and a stable dollar helped the German share market post further gains on Tuesday, with many dealers expecting the trend to continue. Chemicals and drugs giant Hoechst was the main highlight, reaching new highs after it said it would merge its specialty chemicals unit with Swiss group Clariant AG in a deal designed dramatically to save costs in the underperforming sector. The wider 30-share DAX index ended bourse trade up 33.76 points, 1.18 percent, at 2,891.00 points, a level held by the IBIS index of electronic trade later on in the day. The gain meant that the index was back close to the levels it had reached before Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan sent global markets tumbling on Friday with his warnings against excessive market exuberance. Dealers said they thought the DAX could now mount the crucial 2,900 point-level soon. "The market factors are all there," said one Frankfurt dealer. "I think we are back on track." Although some dealers said there was still a lot of nervousness in the market, a move past the 2,900 level, which the DAX had reached for the first time last week, should trigger renewed buying interest. "If we hit 2,900 points, then we will be chasing 3,000," another dealer said. Hoechst ended bourse trade up 2.22 points or three percent at 70.90 as analysts welcomed potential cost savings of 600 million marks coming from the deal, which will result in around 5,000 lost jobs. Shares in other chemicals stocks also rose after the news, BASF AG ending bourse trade up 2.4 percent, or 1.48 marks at 62.18 marks, while Bayer also climbed 2.4 percent or 1.50 marks to 64.55 marks. The ongoing feud between German carmaker Volkswagen AG and U.S. rival General Motors Corp was continuing to attract attention. VW ended bourse dealings up nine marks at 612 after its chief executive Ferdinand Piech appeared to take a more conciliatory line by expressing regret over the cost and trouble caused to both sides by the feud. VW has been embroiled in a battle with GM over alleged industrial espionage by Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, once a top level GM executive who transferred to VW in 1993. Lopez resigned from VW in late November. Shares in German truck and machinery manufacturer MAN AG slumped 12 marks to 360 in late IBIS trade after it said it could cut its dividend if its 1996/97 business performance demanded it.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech said Tuesday that he will resist General Motors Corp.'s demand that he apologise over allegations that VW obtained GM corporate secrets when it hired a top executive away from the Detroit carmaker. "I do not expect they will wring it (an apology) out of me," Piech said on German television Tuesday. Piech said Monday that he had the "deepest regrets" for the events surrounding VW's bitter dispute with GM over the transfer of former GM production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua to VW in March 1993. However, he stopped well short of confessing any wrongdoing by VW -- a demand set by GM before it would consider any out-of-court settlement to its U.S. civil lawsuit that charges VW and top officials with racketeering. Piech said a new round of talks with GM could begin by year-end and that other companies were acting as intermediaries to help end the dispute, which some auto industry officials have said could endanger German-U.S. trade relations. The VW chief said he hoped a deal could soon be reached with GM and that he wanted a new round of talks to begin after a third attempt in London in September failed. But Piech added fuel to the battle, telling Germany's Stern magazine in an interview this week that "we have at the moment the better cars and General Motors the better lawyers." He also warned GM to expect a lengthy legal fight, one that "in the end will have no winners" and may cost GM more in Germany than it would VW in the United States, since GM has a stronger presence in Europe than VW has in North America. Piech also told Stern he knew GM wanted him out at VW, saying, "I have said to my supervisory board from the beginning that this does not involve Lopez but instead really me." GM has long demanded that VW apologise before it would consider any settlement to its U.S. lawsuit, which could leave VW facing a jury verdict for billions of dollars. Other demands set out by GM include that VW sever all ties with Lopez (corrects from "sever all ties with GM") and that VW agree to pay for damages. Lopez resigned from the VW management board Nov. 29 but GM officials were incensed that VW appointed a Lopez protege to the job. The Detroit autormaker contends Lopez used the data from GM to cut VW's costs by about 700 million German marks (about $450 million), quickly eroding a 20 percent cost advantage that GM's German unit Opel had over VW, the largest carmaker in Europe. Stern magazine said Tuesday that the VW supervisory board has given Piech, the grandson of VW founder Ferdinand Porsche, until year-end to settle the lawsuit or he could risk not having his contract renewed when it expires next year. A VW spokesman declined to comment on the report. Also Tuesday, sources said German prosecutors would file lesser-than-expected criminal charges involving embezzlement and betrayal against Lopez and some of the colleagues who followed him from GM to VW. The sources said the charges would not include more serious allegations involving fraud, which can carry a jail term of five to 10 years. The expected charges against Lopez are punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine, but first-time offenders do not usually face prison time, according to legal experts. A spokesman for Lopez's lawyer declined to comment.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG, seeking to deflect publicity over allegations it had secret documents from a rival, said on Tuesday it expected 1996 group profit to be clearly above the 1995 levels and hinted at a higher dividend. VW said group sales would reach about 100 billion marks in 1996 and top the 1995 level of 88.1 billion marks. Worldwide deliveries also rose 400,000 to almost four million vehicles. "All group brands have contributed to these positive developments," VW said about the growth in customer vehicle deliveries, particularly outside its main market in Germany. Top profit-producers inside the VW the group were the Volkswagen brand, its luxury car unit Audi, the VW financial services unit as well as the South American region, Africa and Asia-Pacific, the company said in a statement. VW declined to give specific 1996 forecasts. The Wolfsburg-based carmaker reported a 1995 group net profit of 336 million marks while parent net profit was 410 million marks. Volkswagen's debt ratings were also reaffirmed on Tuesday by Standard & Poor's, but the credit agency said it had not factored in the company's running legal battle with U.S. rival General Motors Corp. "With respect to the ongoing litigation between General Motors and Volkswagen, the potential exists for a significant monetary settlement or court judgment which could impact existing ratings," S&P said in a statement. But it added that the likelihood, amount and timing of either a settlement or a decision on damages could not be assessed yet, and the ratings made no assumption about pending litigation. VW has been in a near four-year legal battle with GM over the transfer of a top GM production executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech on Monday said he regretted the trouble and costs suffered by GM over the 1993 transfer of Lopez. He said the transfer was "fully legal" but did not comment directly on allegations that Lopez and seven other former GM associates stole secret documents when the quit GM. The carmaker also said VW and its Audi luxury unit would equally split a 750 million mark investment in a planned production plant in Brazil with the parent company. VW said the new plant would start production of the A3 car by 1998. VW would also produce its Vento model at the plant. Volkswagen said it expected more "positive business developments" in 1997 despite overall difficult industry conditions with little sign of an improvement in demand for automobiles in Germany as well as Europe. "With cautious views on expectations for growth and currency market movements, Volkswagen sees for 1997 further sustained positive business developments," the carmaker said in a statement, noting it would keep up cost-cutting efforts. VW chief financial officer Bruno Adelt told Reuters that the carmaker would consider raising its dividend payout after final profit figures for the year were completed. "If the earnings outlook improves, then we will consider raising the dividend," Adelt told Reuters. Among its foreign units, VW said its Spanish SEAT unit had improved over 1995 and that its Czech Skoda subsidary would "be in the black" with profits by the end of 1996. VW said the worldwide automobile market was uneven during 1996, particularly in Europe. But the carmaker said 11-month sales from January to November showed that it had raised its group-wide west European market share to 17.1 percent from 16.7 percent of a market with sales of about 2.4 million vehicles for 1996. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Mercedes-Benz AG chairman Helmut Werner is not helping to mediate a worsening dispute between Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp, a Daimler spokesman said on Tuesday. Germany's Stern magazine raised speculation that Werner was playing a role in the legal fight between the two car makers, reporting that he had agreed to act as a mediator for VW and GM. "Werner is not an intermediary between VW and GM," the spokesman said. The Mercedes head has said in interviews that he wanted the two companies to call off their legal battle, saying the disagreement was bad for German-U.S. relations. -- Frankfurt Newsroom + 49 697 56525
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG chief executive Ferdinand Piech said he will not directly apologise to General Motors over allegations VW obtained GM secrets when it hired a top GM manager. On Monday, he said he had the "deepest regrets" for the events surrounding VW's bitter dispute with GM over the transfer of former GM production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua to VW in March 1993. "I do not expect to have to apologise to General Motors," Piech said late on Monday at a VW event in Colmar, France. On Tuesday he told Germany's n-tv network "I do not expect they will wring it (an apology) out of me." Piech also said a new round of talks with GM could begin by year-end and that other companies were acting as intermediaries to help bring to an end the fight that some car industry officials have said could endanger German-U.S. trade relations. But he stopped well short of expressing any wrongdoing by VW - a demand set by GM before it would consider any out-of-court settlement to its U.S. lawsuit that charges VW and top officials with racketeering.

Piech also told Stern he knew GM wanted him out at VW, saying, "I have said to my supervisory board from the beginning that this does not involve Lopez but instead really me." GM has long demanded that VW apologise before it would consider any settlement to its U.S. lawsuit, which is based on racketeering laws first used to fight the mafia and could leave VW facing a jury verdict in the billions of dollars. Other demands set out by GM include that VW sever all ties with GM and that VW agree to pay for damages. Lopez resigned from the VW management board on November 29 but GM officials were incensed that VW appointed a Lopez protogee to the job. The Detroit carmaker contends Lopez used the data from GM to cut VW's costs by about 700 million marks, quickly eroding a 20 percent cost advantage that its German unit Opel had over VW, considered the largest carmaker in Europe. Piech made his comment of regret ahead of a Stern magazine report on Tuesday saying VW has asked Mercedes-Benz chief executive Helmut Werner to help end the legal battle. Stern said Werner was an intermediary to help settle the lawsuit in which Piech and other VW executives are defendants. A Mercedes-Benz spokesman denied the report, saying "Werner is not an intermediary between Volkswagen and GM." Werner, who is rumoured to be on the verge of leaving Mercedes, is being viewed as a potential successor to follow Ferdinand Piech as VW chief executive, industry sources say. The VW supervisory board has also given Piech, the grandson of VW founder Ferdinand Porsche, until year-end to settle the lawsuit or he could risk not having his contract renewed when it expires next year, Stern added. A VW spokesman declined comment on the report. Piech also told journalists in Colmar that General Electric chairman Jack Welch was one of the business leaders helping to bring about an end to the dispute. Also on Tuesday, sources said German prosecutors later this week will file lesser-than-expected criminal charges involving embezzlement and betrayal against Lopez and some of the colleagues who followed had him from GM to VW. But the sources said the charges would not include more serious allegations involving fraud that can carry a jail term of five to 10 years. The expected charges against Lopez are punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine, but first-time offenders do not usually face prison time, according to legal experts.

"With respect to the ongoing litigation between General Motors and Volkswagen, the potential exists for a significant monetary settlement or court judgment which could impact existing ratings," S&P said in a statement. But it added the likelihood, amount and timing of either a settlement or a decision on damages could not be assessed yet, and the ratings made no assumption about the pending litigation. S&P said Volkswagen's ratings continued to reflect its position as the leading European automotive volume manufacturer and the strength of its financial profile. "In the face of an increasingly competitive marketplace and with profitability impacted by high German labour costs, Volkswagen continues to take steps to improve its competitive position," it said. S&P affirmed the A plus corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings and the A1 commercial paper rating of Volkswagen AG and related entities. Its rating outlook on VW was stable. S&P said it was confident the effectiveness of cost cutting measures and results of future model programmes will support the sustainability of Volkswagen's current ratings, but questions existed over potential litigation-related pay-outs. VW has been in a nearly four-year legal battle with GM over the transfer of a top GM production executive, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. On Monday, VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech said he regretted the trouble and costs suffered by GM over the 1993 transfer of Lopez. But Piech also said the transfer was "fully legal" and he did not comment directly on allegations that Lopez and seven other former GM associates stole secret documents when the quit GM.

83167>>0>> A reassuring overnight rebound on Wall Street, steady Bunds and a stable dollar helped the German share market post further gains in bourse dealings on Tuesday, with many dealers expecting the trend to continue. The 30-share DAX index ended bourse trade up 33.76 points, 1.18 percent, at 2,891.00 points, climbing back close to the levels it had reached before Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan sent global markets tumbling on Friday with his warnings against excessive market exuberance. By the end of floor trade on Tuesday the DAX had recouped almost all the four percent in value it lost on Friday and looked set to mount the crucial 2,900 point-level soon. "The market factors are all there," said one Frankfurt dealer. "I think we are back on track." Although some dealers said there was still a lot of nervousness in the market, a move past the 2,900 level, which the DAX had reached for the first time last week, should trigger renewed buying interest. "If we hit 2,900 points, then we will be chasing 3,000," another dealer said. The day's biggest DAX gainer was German chemicals and drugs group Hoechst AG, which jumped to record highs on Tuesday after the firm announced it would merge its speciality chemicals business with Swiss group Clariant AG. Shares in Hoechst, which had been briefly suspended while the announcement was made, ended bourse dealings up 2.22 marks, or 3.2 percent, at 70.90 marks, earlier touching an all-time high of 71.20 marks. Shares in other chemicals stocks also rose after the news, BASF AG ending bourse trade up 2.4 percent, or 1.48 marks at 62.18 marks, while Bayer also climbed 2.4 percent or 1.50 marks to 64.55 marks. The ongoing feud between German carmaker Volkswagen AG and U.S. rival General Motors Corp was continuing to attract attention. VW ended bourse dealings up nine marks at 612 after its chief executive Ferdinand Piech appeared to take a more conciliatory line by expressing regret over the cost and trouble caused to both sides by the feud. VW has been embroiled in a battle with GM over alleged industrial espionage by Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, once a top level GM executive who transferred to VW in 1993. Lopez resigned from VW in late November.
83167>>0>> German economics minister Guenter Rexrodt said on Tuesday he planned to seek talks with Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky on the continuing feud between German carmaker Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp. "I will see the American representative (Barshefsky) at the World Trade Organisation conference tomorrow and will address this (issue) in an appropriate way," Rexrodt said from Singapore in an interview with German radio. The economics minister, attending the WTO's ministerial meeting in Singapore, said he wanted to push "to have things handled so that German car manufacturers do not meet with any damage." The cross-channel feud centres on the 1993 transfer from GMT to VW of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, once a top GM executive, who now faces allegations of industrial spying. In a surprise move on Monday, VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech on Monday said he regretted the trouble and costs suffered by General Motors over the affair. A public apology is one of several strict conditions GM has set before it would consider any deal to end its U.S. lawsuit accusing VW of racketeering. However the U.S. firm said that the expression of regret was not enough for fresh talks. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> A reassuring overnight rebound on Wall Street, steady Bunds and a stable dollar helped the German share market post further gains in early dealings on Tuesday, and many dealers expected the trend to continue. The 30-share DAX index started bourse trade up 30.58 points at 2,887.82 points, further paring losses from Friday after Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan sent global markets tumbling with his warnings against excessive market exuberance. "The market factors are all there," said one Frankfurt dealer. "I think we are back on track."

"If we hit 2,900 points, then we will be chasing 3,000," another dealer said. Technical factors dominated dealings, boosting chemical stocks which had taken a beating last week. But the ongoing feud between German carmaker Volkswagen AG and U.S. rival General Motors Corp was continuing to attract attention. VW started out up five marks at 608 after its chief executive Ferdinand Piech appeared to take a more conciliatory note by expressing regret over the cost and trouble caused to both sides by the feud. VW has been embroiled in a battle with GM over alleged industrial espionage by Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, once a top level GM executive who transferred to VW in 1993.

83167>>0>> Ukraine is set to receive $40 million in technical assistance this year under a special European Union programme, a government statement received by Reuters said on Wednesday. "Ukraine will be given $40 million by the end of the year for projects of government reform, economic restructuring, development of the private sector, and development of non-nuclear electrical energy projects," Ukraine's National Agency for Reconstruction and Development said. The agreement under the EU's Tacis plan followed a two-day visit to Brussels by Roman Shpek, head of the agency which holds talks with international lending bodies. Joly Dixon, director of international economic and financial matters at the European Union, will visit Kiev on December 12 and 13 for talks with government officials, a separate EU statement said. The agency said Ukraine was seeking trade deficit support for 1997 and wanted a 400 million ECU (about $625 million) loan to complete construction of the Rivne and Khmelnitsky nuclear reactors, to replace energy lost when Chernobyl closes by 2000. EU officials signed a deal in September giving Ukraine about $675 million in technical aid, and most of the funds were to be distributed over three years as part of the Tacis plan. The plan seeks to bring the economies of eastern Europe up to western European levels. Ukraine is getting about $3 billion in aid and credits to restructure its wasteful energy sector as part of plans to shut Chernobyl, site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986. --Irene Marushko, Kiev Newsroom +380 44 229 2264
83167>>0>> A former top Volkswagen AG executive accused of stealing secret documents when he quit General Motors Corp. in 1993 to join VW was hit with criminal charges, his attorneys said Wednesday. But the lawyers for Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who quit as VW production chief in November, quickly played down the significance of the charges, despite noting that prosecutors said they had "sufficient suspicion" that GM documents were stolen. "The thorough investigation did not conclude that General Motors sustained relevant damage," Juergen Taschke and Eberhard Wahle, who represent Lopez, said in a statement. The public prosecutors' office in Darmstadt near Frankfurt would only say that it would file criminal charges against Lopez and would hold a news conference Friday. Sources have told Reuters that Lopez will face two charges for embezzlement and betrayal against GM. But the indictment does not include more serious fraud charges that can carry up to a 10-year jail term. The expected charges against Lopez are punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine, but first-time offenders do not usually face prison, according to legal experts. The criminal charges add to the mounting legal troubles for Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard who is also the target of a U.S. racketeering lawsuit filed in Detroit by GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG, against VW and several of its top executives. GM is expected to demand in a jury trial damages in the billions of dollars from VW. The award could be tripled under U.S. racketeering laws first used to fight organised crime. Attempts to settle the lawsuit have failed because VW has refused to meet GM's conditions, which include severing ties with Lopez, admitting to wrongdoing and paying for damages. GM on Wednesday also said German prosecutors had informed it that charges would be filed against Lopez proteges: former VW executive Jose Manuel Gutierrez, VW employee Rosario Piazza and Jorge Alvarez, who works at VW's SEAT unit in Spain. It was not yet clear what charges would be filed against Spaniards Gutierrez and Alvarez as well as Piazza, an Italian. Volkswagen said it would take no actions against any employees who might be charged by German prosecutors and moved to quash rumours that the contract of VW management board Chairman Ferdinand Piech would not be renewed past 1997. VW supervisory board Chairman Klaus Liesen said there was "no doubt" that Piech's contract would be extended after recent media reports said Piech may be dropped and replaced by Mercedes-Benz AG Chief Executive Helmut Werner. GM and Opel said their allegations against Lopez and VW were vindicated by the charges and that VW must have been in the possession of secret GM and Opel documents. "By filing the charges, the Darmstadt public prosecutors' office has confirmed the initial suspicion of industrial espionage raised by Adam Opel AG," Opel said, noting it had not yet been given full access to the criminal charges. Volkswagen rejected GM's allegations as being without basis and said GM's attacks have "collapsed like a house of cards." VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said the German criminal charges proved incontestably that a conspiracy at VW to use GM secrets as alleged by the U.S. automaker had never existed. "VW had neither requested nor used any secrets belonging to an outsider," Kocks told Reuters. A GM source scoffed at Kocks' comments, saying the betrayal of secrets charges to be filed against Lopez and others would be linked to allegations they passed on GM documents to VW. "These people are being charged with felonies punishable, if convicted, by jail terms," the GM source said.

83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG will extend the contract of VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech and will not be making any personnel changes after criminal charges were filed against four current or former VW employees, VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen said on Wednesday. Liesen told Reuters there was no doubt the supervisory board would extend Piech's contract at a meeting scheduled for March. Piech's contract is due to expire at the end of 1997.   General Motors Corp, which has alleged that eight current or former VW employees took along secret documents when they left GM to join VW in 1993, said earlier that German prosecutors had told the carmaker that criminal charges have been filed against the former employees. The public prosecutors' office in Darmstadt near Frankfurt also said on Wednesday it would file charges against one of the executives involved in the dispute and that it would hold a news conference on Friday. VW spokesman Klaus Kocks added there was no connection between legal charges made on Wednesday and current jobs held by former GM executives. "There is therefore no need for discussion," Kocks said. --Frankfurt Newsroom + 49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Lawyers for former Volkswagen AG purchasing executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua said on Wednesday that German criminal charges did not assert that General Motors Corp was damaged through alleged industrial espionage when Lopez quit GM to join VW in 1993. The lawyers, Juergen Taschke and Eberhard Wahle, confirmed the charges had been filed against Lopez, noting that the charges by the Darmstadt public prosecutors' office showed "sufficient suspicion" that secret GM documents were taken. But the lawyers said in a statement the German charges do not assert any relevant damage to GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG, by Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, and they claimed the documents in question were not confidential.   The statement by the lawyers also said GM's accusations against Lopez that he stole plans for a new super-efficient factory were unfounded. They also criticised prosecutors for not noting that the factory was also being planned with a Spanish consortium. "The prosecutors themselves have stated that it only involved a very preliminary study for a factory that would have required extensive additional work to be completed," the lawyers said in the statement. In addition, they said the prosecutors' charges did not confirm GM's accusation of collusion between Lopez and top VW executives. GM said on Wednesday that charges were filed against former VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, former VW executive Jose Manuel Gutierrez, current VW employee Rosario Piazza and Jorge Alvarez, now at VW subsidiary SEAT in Spain. Lopez and Gutierrez, who was an executive director in charge of purchasing at GM before joining VW, both resigned from VW after Lopez's lawyers said they expected prosecutors to file the charges by year-end. Lopez led a group of seven workers who followed him to VW and allegedly brought along thousands of secret documents on parts pricing and plans for a new super-efficient factory, which GM alleges was the model for a new VW plant in Brazil. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

A GM source who asked not to be identified scoffed at VW's statements, saying that one of the charges expected to be filed against Lopez was for betrayal of company secrets. "Betrayal of secrets means that they had to be passed onto someone, and that was VW," the source said."These people are being indicted on felonies, punishable by prison sentences if convicted. That speaks for itself." The source also said that VW was out to manipulate public opinion by claiming victory since the carmaker did not face criminal charges in Germany nor any of its top executives. "There is no legal basis for a German prosecutor to file charges against a company as are in this issue," the source said.

83167>>0>> General Motors Corp said on Wednesday that German prosecutors have informed them that criminal charges would be filed against four former executives who allegedly stole secret documents when they quit in March 1993 to join rival Volkswagen AG. The public prosecutors' office in Darmstadt near Frankfurt said earlier on Wednesday that it would hold a news conference on Friday to discuss the charges it would file against the former executives of GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG.   Opel said prosecutors would file charges against former VW management board member Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, former VW executive Jose Manuel Gutierrez as well as Jorge Alvarez, an executive at VW subsidiary SEAT and VW employee Rosario Piazza. "By filing the charges, the Darmstadt public prosecutors' office has confirmed the suspicion of industrial espionage which Adam Opel AG has voiced right from the start," Opel said, noting it had not yet been given access to the charges. Lopez resigned from VW in late November amid allegations he and the others to be named in the indictment took the secret data from GM when he left to join VW in 1993. His lawyer has said that he expected criminal charges to be filed against his client. Sources have said Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, would face lesser-than-expected criminal charges involving embezzlement and betrayal against GM. But the sources said the charges would not include more serious allegations involving fraud that can carry a jail term of five to 10 years. The expected charges against Lopez are punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine, but first-time offenders do not usually face prison, according to legal experts.

83167>>0>> German prosecutors will hold a news conference on Friday at 0930 GMT to make public whether they will file criminal charges against former Volkswagen AG production executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. The public prosecutors' office in Darmstadt, a city near Frankfurt, said the briefing would be held at its office. Lopez resigned from VW in late November amid allegations he took secret data from General Motors Corp when he left to join VW in 1993. His lawyer has said that he expected criminal charges to be filed against his client.   Sources have said Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, would face lesser-than-expected criminal charges involving embezzlement and betrayal against GM. Charges would also be filed against some of the colleagues who followed him from GM to VW. But the sources said the charges would not include more serious allegations involving fraud that can carry a jail term of five to 10 years. The expected charges against Lopez are punishable by up to three years in prison or a fine, but first-time offenders do not usually face prison, according to legal experts. GM contends that Lopez used the data from GM to cut VW's costs by more than a billion marks, quickly eroding a 20 percent cost advantage that its German unit Opel had over VW, Europe's largest carmaker. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Australia's national intelligence agency is increasingly concerned by economic and technical espionage, although old-fashioned political and military spying is still a worry. In its annual report to parliament, tabled on Tuesday, the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO) said some foreign governments sent agents into Australia with "shopping lists" of information or technology. "While a considerable amount of public material is available to them, their activities become of security concern if they engage in deception or cause Australia to be disadvantaged economically or in other ways," ASIO said. The agency started an investigation early this year into the extent Australian scientific information and technology were being targetted by foreign economic espionage. During the year it has contacted industry groups, research centres and manufacturing firms, asking whether they knew of or suspected espionage attempts against them. It said their responses would help ASIO assess how much economic espionage was happening, and which governments were to blame, for a confidential report to the Australian government. ASIO said hostile activity by foreign intelligence agencies could take several forms, including not just espionage but attempts to interfere with Australia's internal politics. "Globally, the trend is toward a greater concentration on economic, scientific and technical espionage, although traditional political and military espionage is still attempted," ASIO said. -- Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800
83167>>0>> Volkswagen's Spanish unit on Thursday shrugged aside criminal charges against cost-cutting wizard "Superlopez", the executive at the heart of an industrial espionage row with U.S. giant General Motors. A spokesman for Sociedad Espanola de Automoviles de Turismo SA (Seat) told Reuters "This matter doesn't affect Seat at all." German prosecutors said on Wednesday that former top Volkswagen AG executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua would face criminal charges for allegedly stealing secret documents when he quit General Motors Corp in 1993 to join VW. The 55-year-old Spaniard remains on Seat's board after recently resigning from VW. The Seat board will hold its first meeting since Lopez's resignation on December 18, the spokesman said. Lopez is expected to soon resign from his position on the Seat board, a Seat union source said. In addition, he said that the chairman of Seat, Joan Llorens, whose contract with the company expires this month, will not continue in his post. "They haven't communicated anything with us officially, but from the news that goes out and conversations with Llorens himself one can deduce that he isn't going to continue as president, but that he will occupy a position as a consultant for the company," the union source said. There has been talk of Llorens' resignation since this spring and press reports have repeatedly pointed to the Belgian Pierre-Alain de Smedt, currently with Volkswagen do Brasil, as his potential successor. The Seat spokesman gave no comment, except to say that Finance Chief Utz Claasen has presented his official resignation and is moving to a different company in Germany. The spokesman said that very few of Lopez's aides remain at Seat. One of his close associates, Jorge Alvarez, former Seat vice president of sales, left this position one year ago and is now working at Volkswagen Coaching. Another close colleague of Lopez's and his successor as purchasing manager at Volkswagen Franciso Garcia Sanz, is currently a member of Seat's board. Seat employee Rosario Piazza, who forms part of Lopez's closest aides, does not hold an executive position at the group. GM said on Wednesday that it had filed charges against a former VW executive, Jose Manuel Gutierrez, and Piazza and Alvarez. All of this news coincides with a decisive new era for Seat. On Wednesday, VW president Ferdinand Piech reiterated on German television that Seat's objective was to generate earnings in 1997 without any outside help. In 1996 Seat expects earnings of three billion pesetas thanks to support from the parent company. Next year, Seat wants to raise its production by 12 percent to 465,000 cars in an effort to put an end to the restructuing process begun in 1993 with losses of 151 billion pesetas ($1.16 billion).

83167>>0>> The former GM executive who defected to Volkswagen asked a federal judge Friday to delay General Motors Corp.'s spying case against him and said he would refuse to testify if forced to come to the United States. Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, accused by GM of taking company secrets to Volkswagen AG in March 1993, has been charged by German prosecutors along with three others with embezzlement and betrayal of corporate secrets. GM is suing Lopez in a civil suit brought in federal court in Detroit. Lawyers representing Lopez and Jose Manuel Gutierrez, another former GM executive who followed Lopez to VW, filed a motion to delay the case in federal court. A hearing on the motion, which had been expected, was set for Jan. 29, 1997. Attorneys argued the GM case should be delayed while the two men defend themselves against the criminal charges in Germany. Lopez and the others were accused of stealing thousands of documents and computer discs containing secret GM data relating to parts pricing, products and manufacturing plans, when they defected to VW in March 1993. GM filed its suit in federal court in March making similar charges. Lopez, who was VW's top purchasing executive, and Gutierrez, have resigned from Volkswagen to prepare their criminal defense. Because the criminal and civil claims are similar, the two will be unable to respond to GM's allegations because of the risk of incriminating themselves in the criminal case, the motion said. "Lopez and Gutierrez have a constitutional right not to be compelled to furnish the government with even a 'link in the chain of evidence' which might ultimately be used against them, either directly or circumstantially, in a criminal proceeding," the motion said. If U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds refuses to delay GM's civil suit, attorneys for the men asked that she temporarily halt the fact-finding process in the case. They also asked that she not force Lopez and Gutierrez to return to the United States to give sworn statements known as depositions. The lawyers said the men would be advised to not answer questions under their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Because the two also face a "real possibility" of U.S. criminal charges, according to their lawyers, the Justice Department could serve them with subpoenas and arrest them if they appeared in Detroit. "It is a risk they should not be required to assume while German charges are pending and U.S. charges are threatened," the motion said. GM spokesman John Mueller said Friday the company expects its case to proceed against all the defendants at the same time. He declined to comment on whether GM's case would be hurt if it cannot question Lopez. Volkswagen said that since it was not implicated in the German criminal investigation, the filing of charges against Lopez cleared the way for new talks to settle GM's civil suit filed in Detroit. But a GM official dismissed VW's comments, saying there were no talks planned and that the U.S. lawsuit had nothing to do with the German criminal probe. German prosecutors said they found no evidence that VW executives colluded in the transfer of secrets -- contrary to the allegations made by GM -- even though the data were used by the defendants in presentations to VW executives. The prosecutors declined to say when a trial could begin. In the meantime, Lopez, 55, who is believed to be living in his native Spain after resigning from the VW management board in late November, and the others would remain free. If convicted in Germany, the defendants could face up to five years in prison or a fine. But legal experts say first-time offenders do not usually face prison.
83167>>0>> Lawyers representing Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua on Friday asked a U.S. federal judge to delay General Motors Corp's lawsuit so he can concentrate on defending himself against criminal charges in Germany. German prosecutors charged Lopez and three others on December 10 with misappropriating trade secrets from GM and its Adam Opel AG unit. GM filed a civil lawsuit alleging Lopez and several others stole confidential documents when they defected to Volkswagen AG in March 1993.   In addition to Lopez, attorneys asked for a delay in GM's suit against one of the other defendants, Jose Manuel Gutierrez.  Both Lopez, who was VW's purchasing chief, and Gutierrez, have resigned from Volkswagen to prepare their defense in the criminal charges. Attorneys argued the two will face "tremendous prejudice" if they have to defend themselves against both the German criminal and GM civil charges at the same time.  Because the criminal and civil claims are similar, the two will be unable to respond to most, if not all, of GM's allegations because of the risk of incriminating themselves, the motion said.   "Lopez and Gutierrez have a constitutional right not to be compelled to furnish the government with even a 'link in the chain of evidence' which might ultimately be used against them, either directly or circumstantially, in a criminal proceeding," the motion says. Attorneys for the two said Lopez and Gutierrez also face a "real possibility" of criminal charges in the U.S. If U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds denied the motion to stay the case, attorneys asked that she not force Lopez and Gutierrez to return to the U.S. to give sworn statements, or depositions. Attorneys said their presence in the U.S. would be irrelevant since Lopez and Gutierrez would refuse to answer questions under their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Moreover, the U.S. Department of Justice could serve them with subpoenas and arrest them if they appeared in Detroit, their lawyers argued. "It is a risk they should not be required to assume while German charges are pending and U.S. charges are threatened," the motion said.
83167>>0>> German prosecutors said Friday that criminal charges have been filed against four former General Motors Corp. executives alleging that they stole corporate secrets when they left GM to join Volkswagen. Charges were filed against former VW production executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and three other former GM employees, Jose Manuel Gutierrez, Rosario Piazza and Jorge Alvarez, who followed Lopez to VW in March 1993. They are accused of taking more than 20,000 documents and computer discs with millions of pages of secret GM data with them when they joined the German carmaker, Europe's biggest. "The aim of obtaining these documents was to use them in the interest of VW after the transfer there," Gerhard Andres, chief prosecutor at the Darmstadt prosecutors' office, said. Prosecutors said, however, they found no evidence that VW executives colluded in the transfer of secrets -- contrary to allegations made by GM -- even though the data was used by the defendants in presentations to VW executives. The four were officially charged Dec. 6 with embezzlement and betrayal of corporate secrets. The charges must now be reviewed by a court, which will determine whether the evidence supports the allegations. Prosecutors declined to predict when a trial could begin. In the meantime, Lopez, 55, who is believed to be living in his native Spain after resigning from the VW management board in late November, and the others would remain free. If convicted, the defendants could face up to five years in prison or a fine. But legal experts say first-time offenders do not usually face prison. Gutierrez, also a Spaniard, also resigned from VW in November, but Piazza, an Italian, and Alvarez, the son of a Spanish industrialist, are still working in Spain for VW or for consulting groups tied to VW. Andres said the 60-page indictment alleges that Lopez began forming plans to obtain secret GM documents after meeting with VW management board member Ferdinand Piech in November 1993 to discuss his joining the Wolfsburg, Germany-based carmaker. Then, it is alleged, Lopez approached Gutierrez, Piazza and Alvarez about following him to Volkswagen and they began collecting secret GM data -- on research, planning and purchasing for new factories as well as GM cars under development -- before they left for GM. Lawyers for Lopez said after the charges were announced that they were based on statements from GM officials and circumstantial evidence. They also said many documents in question had been handed out to suppliers at GM meetings or were completed in conjunction with a Spanish consortium studying building a new factory in Spain. Prosecutors said the charges did not assess the amount of damage that GM suffered through the loss of its documents because that task was not part of their probe. Andres also stated that prosecutors in the course of their investigation had found no evidence that VW staff had colluded with Lopez in the theft of documents. "I say with all clarity that we always kept an eye on this suspicion," Andres told a news conference. "But the investigation found no sufficient indications that someone from VW in any way colluded in the alleged deeds as we have presented them here relating to Lopez and the others." Volkswagen said Friday that, since it was not implicated in the German criminal investigation, the filing of charges against Lopez cleared the way for new talks to settle the civil lawsuit GM filed against it in Detroit. But a GM official dismissed VW's comments, saying there were no talks planned and that the U.S. lawsuit had nothing to do with the German criminal probe. "As we said all along, the criminal charges in Germany have nothing to do with the U.S. civil court lawsuit," a GM source said. "There are no settlement discussions at present. Nor are any planned." The German criminal charges add to the troubles for Lopez, who also faces a U.S. criminal probe by prosecutors in Detroit in addition to GM's lawsuit, which is partially based on the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisation law first used to fight organised crime. GM is expected to demand in a jury trial damages in the hundreds of millions of dollars from VW since it claims Lopez used its documents to cut costs by more than a billion marks ($648 million) and that its cost advantages over VW were reduced. Any award by a jury could be tripled under the racketeering law. Previous attempts to settle the U.S. lawsuit have failed because VW has rejected GM's conditions, which are that it sever ties with Lopez, admit to wrongdoing and pay damages.
83167>>0>> German prosecutors, ending a 3-1/2 year probe, said on Friday criminal charges have been filed against four former General Motors Corp executives who they allege stole secret documents when they left GM in 1993 to join Volkswagen AG. But prosecutors said they found no evidence VW executives colluded in the transfer of secrets -- contrary to allegations made by GM -- even though they said some of the data was used by the former GM workers in presentations to VW executives. Charges were filed against former VW production executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and three other former GM employees identified as Jose Manuel Gutierrez, Rosario Piazza and Jorge Alavarez, who followed Lopez to VW in March 1993. "The aim of obtaining these documents was to use them in the interest of VW after the transfer there," said Gerhard Andres, chief prosecutor at the Darmstadt prosecutors' office. Lopez and the others, if convicted, could face up to five years in prison or a fine. But legal experts say first-time offenders for such an offence do not usually face prison terms. The four were officially charged on December 6 under allegations of embezzlement and betrayal of corporate secrets. The charges must now be approved by a court which will determine whether the evidence supports the allegations. Prosecutors declined to predict when a trial could begin. In the meantime, the 55-year-old Lopez, who is believed to be now living in Spain after he resigned from the VW management board in late November, and the others will remain free. Gutierrez, a Spaniard, resigned his position as a top VW production executive in November, but Piazza, an Italian, and Alvarez, the son of a Spanish industrialist, are still working in Spain for VW or for consulting groups tied to VW. Andres said more than 20,000 documents and computer diskettes with millions of pages of data were taken, including plans for a factory called "Plant X" in Spain, pricing data for European cars and cost data on GM vehicles as well as documents for a new car being developed by GM called the "O-Car." He said the 60-page indictment alleges Lopez began forming plans to obtain secret GM and Opel documents after meeting with VW management board member Ferdinand Piech on November 29, 1993, to discuss his joining the Wolfsburg-based carmaker. Lopez then approached Gutierrez, Piazza and Alvarez about following him to Volkswagen and they allegedly began collecting secret GM data on research, planning and purchasing for new factories as well as top-selling GM cars under development before they left for GM in March 1993, Andres said. Lawyers for Lopez said in a statement after the charges were announced that they were based on statements from GM officials and circumstantial evidence. They also said many documents in question had been handed out to suppliers at GM meetings or were completed in conjunction with a Spanish consortium studying the factory. Prosecutors said the charges did not measure the amount of damage GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG, suffered because that task was not part of their probe. Andres also clearly stated that prosecutors in the course of their investigation had found no evidence that VW staff had colluded with Lopez in the theft of documents. "I say with all clarity that we always kept an eye on this suspicion," Andres told a news conference. "But the investigation found no sufficient indications that someone from VW in any way colluded in the alleged deeds as we have presented them here relating to Lopez and the others." Volkswagen said on Friday the charges against Lopez cleared the way for fresh talks with GM to settle its U.S. racketeering lawsuit against the German carmaker since it was not implicated in the German criminal investigation. Shares in Volkswagen, recently under stiff pressure, rose in bourse dealings after U.S. brokerage house Lehman Brothers raised its VW rating to "outperform" from "neutral". VW ended bourse trade up 3.75 marks at 603.75 marks. Germany's Die Welt newspaper reported on Friday that top VW and GM executives may meet next week in New York for talks, also helping to underpin VW shares while the broader 30-share DAX index fell more than 1.6 percent in active dealings. But GM officials dismissed VW's call for talks, saying no secret talks were underway nor any planned and that the U.S. lawsuit had nothing to do with the German criminal probe. "There are no current talks and none are planned," Opel management board member Horst Borghs told Reuters. The German criminal charges add to the troubles for Lopez, who also faces a U.S. grand jury investigation by prosecutors in Detroit and a German labour court hearing in Braunschweig. GM is expected to demand billions of dollars of damages in a jury trial from VW since GM claims Lopez used its documents at VW to cut costs by more than a billion marks ($647.7 million) and that its cost advantages over VW were reduced. Any U.S. lawsuit award by a jury could be tripled under the U.S. racketeering laws first used to fight the mafia. Previous attempts to settle the U.S. lawsuit have failed because VW has rejected GM's conditions which are that it sever ties with Lopez, admit to wrongdoing and pay damages. ($1=1.5439 Mark)

But a GM official dismissed VW's comments, saying there were no talks planned and that the U.S. lawsuit had nothing to do with the German criminal probe. "As we said all along, the criminal charges in Germany have nothing to do with the U.S. civil court lawsuit," a GM source said. "There are no settlement discussions at present. Nor are any planned." The German criminal charges add to the troubles for Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard who also faces a U.S. criminal probe by prosecutors in Detroit in addition to GM's lawsuit, which is partially based on the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisation law first used to fight the mafia. GM is expected to demand in a jury trial damages in the billions of dollars from VW since it claims Lopez used its documents to cut costs by more than a billion marks ($647.7 million) and that its cost advantages over VW were reduced. Any U.S. lawsuit award by a jury could be tripled under the U.S. racketeering law. Previous attempts to settle the U.S. lawsuit have failed because VW has rejected GM's conditions, which are that it sever ties with Lopez, admit to wrongdoing and pay damages. Andres said the 60-page indictment alleges Lopez began forming plans to obtain secret GM and Opel documents after meeting with VW management board Chairman Ferdinand Piech on Nov. 29, 1993, to discuss joining the Wolfsburg-based carmaker. Lopez then approached Gutierrez, Piazza and Alvarez about following him to Volkswagen and they allegedly began collecting secret GM data on research, planning and purchasing for new factories as well as top-selling GM cars under development, according to prosecutors. Gutierrez resigned his position as a top VW production executive in November, but Piazza and Alvarez are still working for VW or for consulting groups tied to VW. "The aim of obtaining these documents was to use them in the interest of VW after the transfer there," Andres said. "The accused did not hand the documents back to Opel or General Motors when they left, but kept them for themselves." Andres said the tens of thousands of documents included plans for a factory called "Plant X" in Spain, pricing data for European production and cost data on GM vehicles as well as documents for a new car being developed by GM called the "O-Car."
83167>>0>> German prosecutors, ending a 3-1/2 year probe, said on Friday criminal charges have been filed against four former General Motors Corp executives who they allege stole secret documents when they left GM in 1993 to join Volkswagen. But prosecutors said they found no evidence VW executives colluded in the transfer of secrets -- contrary to allegations made by GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG -- even though the data was used by Lopez in presentations to VW executives. Charges were filed against former VW production executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and three other former GM employees identified as Jose Manuel Gutierrez, Rosario Piazza and Jorge Alavarez, who followed Lopez to VW in March 1993. Lopez, if convicted, and the others could face up to five years in prison or a fine. But legal experts say first-time offenders do not usually face prison. The charges must now be approved by a German court and prosecutors declined to predict when a trial could begin. In the meantime, Lopez, who is believed to be living in Spain, and the others would remain free. Gerhard Andres, the chief prosecutor at the Darmstadt public prosecutors' office, said the four were officially charged on December 6 under allegations of embezzlement and betrayal of corporate secrets. Prosecutors said the charges did not measure the amount of damage that GM suffered through the loss of its documents because that task was not part of their probe. Andres also clearly stated that prosecutors in the course of their investigation had found no evidence that VW staff had colluded with Lopez in the theft of documents. "I say with all clarity that we always kept an eye on this suspicion," Andres told a news conference. "But the investigation found no sufficient indications that someone from VW in any way colluded in the alleged deeds as we have presented them here relating to Lopez and the others." Volkswagen said on Friday the charges against Lopez cleared the way for fresh talks with GM to settle its U.S. racketeering lawsuit against the German carmaker since it was not implicated in the German criminal investigation. Germany's Die Welt newspaper reported on Friday that top VW and GM executives may meet next week in New York for talks. But a GM official dismissed VW's comments, saying there were no secret talks underway nor any planned and that the U.S. lawsuit had nothing to do with the German criminal probe. "As we said all along, the criminal charges in Germany have nothing to do with the U.S. civil court lawsuit," the GM source told Reuters.

83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG sources said on Friday German criminal charges against four executives who left General Motors Corp with documents in 1993 to join VW clears the way for talks to end a U.S. lawsuit GM filed against VW. But a GM source said no talks were currently planned nor any scheduled between the two carmakers to settle the racketeering lawsuit, adding the German criminal charges had no relation to the U.S. lawsuit in a Detroit federal court. "As we said all along, the criminal charges in Germany have nothing to do with the U.S. civil court lawsuit," the GM source said. "There are no settlement discussions at present or are any planned."
83167>>0>> Adam Opel AG said on Friday that charges German prosecutors filed against four former General Motors Corp executives confirm Opel and GM's allegations of industrial espionage. "It is a clear statement by an independent prosecutor that the allegations made by Opel and General Motors concerning the embezzlement and betrayal of company secrets were well-founded," Opel said in a statement. The Darmstadt prosecutor's office said it filed charges against former Volkswagen production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and three other GM employees who left GM in 1993 to join VW. GM says the executives took secret company docuements with them when they left -- documents which helped VW cut costs and make itself more competitive with GM and its German unit Opel.

83167>>0>> German carmaker Volkswagen AG said on Friday it had no comment to make on statements by German prosecutors on the charges of embezzlement and betrayal of corporate secrets facing its former management board member Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. The Darmstadt public prosecutor's office had held a news conference giving details on the charges brought on December 6 against Lopez, a former executive at General Motors and three other former GM employees. The four have been accused of stealing secret documents when they quit the U.S. carmaker in 1993 to join rival Volkswagen. Volkswagen spokesman Klaus Kocks, in response to a Reuter enquiry, noted that media reports had said the prosecutor's office had found no evidence that VW colluded with the accused. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> German prosecutors said on Friday they had found no indication that staff at Volkswagen AG had colluded with VW's former production chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, and three other former General Motors executives in alleged embezzlement and the betrayal of GM secrets. Asked if the prosecutors had in their investigation of alleged industrial espionage by Lopez found that VW colluded in the alleged transfer of GM secrets to VW, Gerhard Andres, the leading prosecutor in the Darmstadt public prosecutor's office, said: "I say with all clarity that although we always kept an eye on this suspicion the investigation found no sufficient indications that someone from VW in any way colluded in the alleged deeds as we have presented them here relating to Lopez and the others." "Instead we could only ascertain that insofar as talks were held with Mr Lopez they only related to his transfer to the VW group."

83167>>0>> Top executives from Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp may meet next week to try to resolve a looming legal battle between the two firms, a German newspaper reported on Friday. The daily Die Welt reported that VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen and Lower Saxony state premier Gerhard Schroeder would meet with GM executives John Smale and Thomas Wyman. GM has alleged that former VW executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua took secret docuements from GM in 1993 when he quit the U.S. carmaker to join Volkswagen. The two carmakers reportedly met in September on the Lopez affair, but made little progress toward averting a wider legal fight. GM is expected to demand damages from VW at a jury trial  in the billions of dollars. The award could be tripled under U.S. racketeering laws first used to fight the mafia. Attempts to settle the suit have failed because VW has rejected GM's conditions, which include severing all ties with Lopez, admitting wrongdoing and paying for damages. The newspaper said VW might attempt to win GM over to an out-of-court settlement by offering to help the U.S. carmaker develop business in China -- a country where VW already has a strong presence. It went on to say that a major stumbling block to any deal was differences of opinion held by GM and its German unit Adam Opel AG. The German unit, the newspaper said, was less willing to compromise than GM management in Detroit. Lopez quit VW in late November to prepare his legal defence, but VW has said it may still work with Lopez on consulting projects. Lopez's problems would not be entirely averted even if a deal were made with GM. German prosecutors have filed criminal charges against him. Sources have told Reuters that Lopez would face two charges for embezzlement and betrayal against GM. --Frankfurt Newsroom + 49 69 756525
83167>>0>> A senior Volkswagen official hopes criminal charges filed by German prosecutors in the Lopez case of alleged industrial espionage could influence the U.S. lawsuit on the matter, a German newspaper said on Saturday. On Friday, German prosecutors said charges had been filed against four former General Motors executives including Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua -- who went on to become VW's chief of production -- accusing them of stealing GM documents when they left the U.S. car-maker for VW in 1993. But the prosecutors said they found no evidence that VW executives colluded in the transfer of secrets, contrary to allegations made by GM. Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper said Klaus Liesen, VW's supervisory board chairman, said he hoped General Motors would now remove such accusations from a U.S. trial that could result in GM demanding huge damages. "I can only assume that GM will now take the opportunity to examine whether the part of the (U.S.) civil action directed against VW board members in office can still be justified," he was quoted in an advance copy of ahead of publication on Sunday. Lopez, who resigned from VW in November, is accused of stealing secrets from his former employer, including plans for a new factory in Spain and documents for a new car being developed by GM. German prosecutors said the charges filed on Friday did not measure the extent of potential damages because it was not their role to do so. VW shares have recently been under stiff pressure on the Frankfurt stock exchange, where they are among the DAX-30 index of leading German stocks. --Mark John, Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> A third of Germans might boycott U.S. goods if high damages were awarded against Volkswagen AG in a case of alleged industrial spying, said a survey published at the weekend. Four ex-General Motors executives, including Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who went on to become VW's chief of production, have been accused of stealing GM documents when they left the U.S. car-maker for VW in 1993. Lopez, who resigned from VW in November, is accused of stealing plans for a new factory in Spain and documents for a new car being developed by GM. The accusations are being tried in both Germany and the United States, where GM is bringing a racketeering lawsuit that could lead to huge damages against the German car-maker. The survey, published in the weekly German news magazine Focus, also found that 42 percent of the Germans questioned said that damages "in the regions of billions" of marks (dollars) would be unjustified. Boycotts by German consumers have in the past exerted strong influence, even on multinational companies. Last year, oil giant Shell was forced to abandon plans to ditch its obsolete Brent Spar oil rig in the Atlantic after a campaign by environmental group Greenpeace including a German boycott of Shell petrol stations. Automotive analysts say that GM and its German unit Opel needs to take possible harm to its public image in Germany into account as they proceed with their legal battle against Volkswagen.

83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG Chairman Ferdinand Piech has asked a top Ford Motor Corp. executive to help mediate its legal fight with General Motors Corp., Germany's Manager Magazine said on Monday. The magazine said Piech had invited the head of Ford's worldwide automotive operations, Jacques Nasser, to a dinner meeting in Germany that was held in early December. The two executives discussed ways to reach an out-of-court settlement of GM's allegations in a U.S. lawsuit that former GM executives left the U.S. automaker and brought along secret documents to VW in 1993, according to the report. Volkswagen declined immediate comment on the report. The magazine said VW was considering offering to buy 100 million German marks ($64.5 million) worth of parts such as batteries from GM as part of an effort to convince the Detroit carmaker to drop its legal action against the German carmaker. The magazine said VW board member Klaus Liesen had sought other intermediaries in the dispute with GM, including former German economics minister Otto Count Lambsdorff. But the magazine said the efforts had failed. At the centre of the fight between GM and VW is Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua who GM alleges stole secret documents when he left the American car maker to join VW. A German court on Friday said it was filing charges against Lopez and three others for embezzlement and betrayal of corporate secrets. In addition to those charges, Lopez faces a grand jury investigation by prosecutors in Detroit -- proceedings VW hopes to avoid by reaching an out-of-court settlement. GM is expected to demand billions of dollars in damages in a jury trial from VW since GM claims Lopez used its documents at VW to cut costs by more than a billion marks ($645 million). Previous attempts to settle the U.S. lawsuit have failed because VW has rejected GM's conditions which are that it sever ties with Lopez, admit wrongdoing and pay damages.

83167>>0>> The chief of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said on Tuesday foreign espionage still posed a major threat to national interests five years after the end of the Cold War. Nikolai Kovalyov, speaking at a rare news conference, said organised crime and terrorism were also seriously undermining Russia's security as it moved towards a free market economy. "Suppressing the activities of foreign intelligence on the territory of our country continues to be the main task of the FSB. Unfortunately we cannot expect any diminution in their activities in the coming years," Kovalyov said. He said the FSB had exposed some 400 employees of foreign intelligence organisations and 39 Russian citizens working for them in the past two years. The FSB has also uncovered more than 100 attempts by Russian citizens to pass on intelligence to foreign organisations on their own initiative, Kovalyov added. He singled out the case of Platon Obukhov, a foreign ministry official charged with high treason earlier this year after passing on secrets to Britain. Kovalyov said Obukhov had seriously damaged Russia's national interests. The case triggered a Cold War-style tit-for-tat expulsion row in which London declared four Russian diplomats persona non grata in response to Moscow's decision to expel the same number of British Embassy employees. Kovalyov said Russia had recently lodged an official protest with Turkey over suspected espionage activity in the sensitive Northern Caucasus region that includes breakaway Chechnya. Russia is currently withdrawing its troops from Chechnya after a failed 21-month military campaign to crush the region's independence bid. Asked about the danger of increased terrorist activity in the region, Kovalyov said it was in the interests of the Chechen separatist government to tackle the problem. "They have to show that they can control the situation in their country...If there is an explosion of terrorist activity in Chechnya it will be a big blow to their authority," he said. Earlier on Tuesday six Western staff members of the International Committee of the Red Cross were killed in their beds in the worst incident involving foreign aid workers in the turbulent oil-rich region. Russian and Chechen officials are also trying to negotiate the release of 21 Russian Interior Ministry troops seized by rebel gunmen at the weekend. Kovalyov said the FSB had already helped free 111 Russians taken hostage by separatists during nearly two years of war. He said he was alarmed by an upsurge in terrorist acts carried out with no apparent motive as these were particularly difficult crimes to solve. Moscow's Metro and trolleybuses were the target of several mysterious bomb attacks earlier this year. Kovalyov said the FSB would shortly publish the results of its investigation into the attacks, which threw security chiefs into panic at the time. But Kovalyov said President Boris Yeltsin's decision last year to set up a special anti-terrorist centre in the FSB had greatly facilitated Russia's fight against terrorism. The FSB is also battling to control organised crime, whose tentacles reach into the highest echelons of power as criminal groups lobby state organs to protect their shady business interests, he said. Some 500 state officials are currently under investigation on suspicion of taking bribes, usually involving huge sums of money, Kovalyov said.
83167>>0>> Germany's opposition Social Democrats on Tuesday pressed the government to toughen protection against industrial espionage, claiming trade thefts cost German companies as much as 20 billions marks ($13 billion) last year. Long-term snooping by corporate competitors and foreign intelligence services could also undermine German jobs and the country's economic strength, the SPD said at a news conference. "It can be very damaging for firms if they face Eastern European competitors who can get stolen technology and have the advantage of low labour costs," said Ernst Schwanhold, spokesman for the SPD fraction in the Bundestag. "It is cheaper to steal than to innovate," he said. The recent case between General Motors Corp. and Volkswagen AG offers only one high-profile example damages that may result from trade theft, Schwanhold said. In that case, Jose Ignacio Lopez, former purchasing chief at GM's Adam Opel unit, is accused in American and German courts of taking production secrets to Volkswagen in 1993. He has resigned from VW, but the German car maker could face billions of dollars in damage payments, if found guilty. About a thousand cases of espionage against German firms go unnoticed or unreported each year, according to the main German police union, which joined the SPD's call for stiffer fines and jail terms trade thefts. Companies often don't want thefts to generate negative publicity, or judge the penalties too small to warrant the effort, said union chief Hermann Lutz. Most involve German companies spying on their German competitors, but a growing number involve intelligence services from Eastern European countries trying to help firms in their countries compete, Lutz added. The SPD would not want to use Germany's secret service for industrial espionage, although the U.S. and Russia, like France, were widely believed to do so, he and Lutz said. A spokesman for Kohl's Christian Democrat party said economic spying would likely become a topic of discussion in parliament in the coming weeks.
83167>>0>> The FBI arrested its own agent, Earl Edwin Pitts, on Wednesday for allegedly selling national security secrets to Russia since 1987 for more than $224,000 in the second spy case to erupt in a month. The FBI said the arrest of Pitts, a 13-year veteran, capped a 16-month undercover operation, with U.S. agents posing as Russian spies and the use of a former Russian (corrects from KGB) officer at the United Nations in New York who later became an FBI informant. FBI officials unveiled the evidence against Pitts, including a call from his wife -- herself an ex-FBI employee -- suspicious of his activites and a letter he wrote last week admitting giving the Russians all he could from 1987 to 1992. "Nothing was sacred to Pitts. He was willing to betray his country, his agency and his fellow agents," U.S. Attorney Helen Fahey, whose office will prosecute the case, told a news conference at FBI headquarters. It marked the second spy case to rock Washington and Moscow in a month. The FBI on Nov. 18 arrested veteran CIA officer Harold Nicholson on charges of spying for Russia. Pitts, who had been in the New York FBI unit responsible for catching Russian spies, was arrested where he now works at the FBI's training facility in Quantico, Virginia. Pitts, a 43-year-old lawyer who conducted security briefings for FBI personnel at the facility, was taken into custody without incident, and invoked his legal right to have an attorney, FBI officials said. He was charged with attempted espionage, conspiracy to commit espionage, communication of classified information and conveyance without authority of government property. Pitts was taken to federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, where a federal judge ordered him held in jail pending a bail hearing, set tentatively for Friday. A slightly built man with close-cropped brown hair, Pitts faces a maximum penalty of life in prison, prosecutors said. FBI Director Louis Freeh said the agency became suspicious of Pitts after it recruited the unidentified Russian (corrects from KGB) official, who was described in court papers as a "cooperating witness." He said the FBI at the same time in the spring of 1993 was suspicious a Russian role may have penetrated the FBI's New York office, based on the failure of various operations. Pitts's financial and travel records also raised questions. The FBI in August 1995 began the undercover or "false flag" operation, with the Russian (corrects from KGB) official who knew Pitts in New York contacting him again at his home in Virginia. He introduced Pitts to a U.S. agent posing as a Russian spy. When his wife Mary, a former FBI support employee, saw Pitts meeting with the Russian on August 26, 1995, she contacted the FBI about his "suspicious" activities. During the undercover operation, Pitts made 22 drops of FBI internal classified information, officials said. An FBI affidavit said Pitts gave the Russians sensitive classified documents on U.S. national defence and personal, medical, and family information about other FBI agents and proposed strategies by which Russia might recruit more agents. He also allegedly made plans to smuggle a Russian intelligence technical expert into the FBI academy and gave his Russian handlers an FBI cipher lock combination, an FBI key and his own FBI identification badge. Freeh said the FBI had yet to complete the damage assessment from the alleged spying, but said Pitts did pose a "continuing threat to national security." Pitts allegedly did compromise the identity of FBI asset who reported covertly on Russian intelligence matters. The FBI chief said the case did not appear to be as damaging as that involving Aldrich Ames, the confessed CIA turncoat arrested in 1994 for betraying numerous agents and passing along some of the nation's most sensitive secrets.
83167>>0>> The FBI arrested one of its own agents, Earl Edwin Pitts, on espionage charges on Wednesday for allegedly passing sensitive classified documents to Russia since 1987 in exchange for more than $224,000. Pitts, 43, who once worked in the New York FBI unit responsible for catching spies, was arrested at work at the FBI's training facility in Quantico, Virginia, and appeared in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, shortly afterwards. He was charged with attempted espionage, conspiracy to commit espionage, communication of classified information and conveyance without authority of government property. Federal Judge Thomas Rawles Jones ordered that Pitts be held in jail pending a bail hearing, set tentatively for Friday. A slightly built man with close-cropped brown hair, Pitts showed no emotion as the judge informed him of his rights and the maximum penalty in the case, which is life imprisonment or the death penalty if certain conditions are met. Officials described it as a serious case, worse than the one last month when CIA officer Harold Nicholson was arrested on charges of spying for Russia. Pitts appeared on Wednesday in the same courtroom where Nicholson was charged earlier. Nicholson, a 16-year CIA veteran who had been chief of station in Romania and deputy chief in Malaysia, was accused of spying for Moscow since June, 1994, in exchange for about $180,000. The highest-ranking CIA officer ever indicted for espionage, he has pleaded not guilty. An FBI affadavit alleged that Pitts conspired with Russian spies from July 1987 through the present -- although he went into a "dormant" capacity in 1992 -- and that he received more than $224,000 from the Russians. It said he gave the Russians sensitive classified documents on U.S. national defence and personal, medical, and family information about other FBI agents and proposed strategies by which Russia might recruit additional agents. He also allegedly made plans to smuggle a Russian intelligence technical expert into the FBI academy and gave his Russian handlers an FBI cipher lock combination, an FBI key and his own FBI identification badge. Pitts, who joined the FBI in 1983, was transferred from New York to be a supervisory special agent at FBI headquarters in the early 1990s. Officials said he was moved to the FBI training facility in 1995 after falling under suspicion. Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh called a news conference at 2:30 P.M. (1930 GMT) at FBI headquarters to discuss the case. The most serious FBI espionage case previously involved Richard Miller, an agent in Los Angeles who was arrested in 1984 on charges of spying for Moscow. He later was convicted. Washington has long suspected that Moscow might have more spies operating in this country after the arrest in 1994 of Aldrich Ames, the confessed CIA turncoat who betrayed numerous agents and passed along some of the nation's most sensitive secrets. But officials said the damage from the FBI case did not appear as great as the Ames case.
83167>>0>> The arrest on Wednesday of yet another alleged Russian agent inside a U.S. intelligence agency shows the spy-against-spy game dies hard and could complicate post-Cold War U.S.-Russian ties, U.S. experts said. FBI director Louis Freeh said the arrest of one of his own after a 16-month sting operation ended a "significant threat to our national security and to the integrity of the Federal Bureau of Investigation by the Russian intelligence service." But Freeh, who spoke at a news conference together with Attorney General Janet Reno, acknowledged that U.S. intelligence agencies were continuing their own long-standing efforts to recruit Russians and steal Moscow's secrets. With agents like alleged FBI turncoat Earl Pitts, Freeh said, the Russians' primary goal was to identify "assets and informants" that U.S. intelligence agencies have signed up. "They're interested in our recruitment methods. They're interested in all of our secret documents. They're interested in our tradecraft and our techniques," Freeh told reporters. Pitts, a 13-year veteran of the FBI, began selling the KGB Soviet intelligence service U.S. spy-catching secrets in July 1987, the FBI alleged in an affadavit. It said he received from the KGB and its Russian successor, the SVRR, at least $224,000 through October, 1992, when he became "dormant." U.S. attorney Helen Fahey told the news conference that Pitts, a 43-year-old attorney, had given law enforcement personnel posing as Russian spymasters personal information about fellow FBI agents who might be "vulnerable to recruitment by Moscow." Pitts listened to the charges against him silently at a pre-trial hearing in the same Alexandria, Virginia, courtroom that was used last month for Harold Nicholson, a 16-year Central Intelligence Agency veteran accused of selling Moscow national security secrets for 29 months until his Nov. 16 arrest. U.S. officials made clear that Pitts' alleged sell-out did far less damage to U.S. security than Nicholson's or that of Aldrich Ames, a 31-year CIA veteran who confessed in April 1994 to unamasking dozens of Soviet and other agents secretly in U.S. pay. But the cumulative impact of the case, compounding as it does the Cold War echoes of the Nicholson and Ames cases, is likely to chill lawmakers considering aid to Russia on Capitol Hill, U.S. analysts said. "Anything that even smacks of being charitable is going to come under greater scrutiny," said Harley Balzer, a Russia expert at the federally funded U.S. Institute of Peace and professor at Georgetown University. "It's happening anyway and this is simply going to enhance that." At least partly because of the impact of such spy cases, Balzer said in telephone interview, he expected little support for programmes set up to provide food and economic help. Instead, the focus would remain squarely on aid for such tasks as dismantling nuclear weapons and dealing with ecologic ills that could become a common threat. But the fact that both the United States and Russia continue to have a huge appetite for each other's secrets should come as no surprise, experts who have monitored intelligence agencies said. After engaging in worldwide cloak-and-dagger mortal combat during the Cold War, both sides continue their espionage above all to make sure they are not taken by military surprise, said Loch Johnson, author of the 1996 book "Secret Agencies: U.S. Intelligence in a Hostile World." Other key reasons for continued spying include wanting to know what others are preparing to do at international conferences on a wide range of issues and advancing foreign trade prospects, said Johnson, a veteran staff member of congressional intelligence oversight panels. "We're going to have spying forever, no doubt, or at least until men become angels," he said. "And unfortunately we're also going to have traders forever."
83167>>0>> An FBI agent identified as Earl Edwin Pitts appeared in federal court on Wednesday after his arrest on charges of passing sensitive classified documents to Russia for money. Federal judge Thomas Rawles Jones ordered that Pitts be held in jail pending a bail hearing, set tentatively for Friday. Pitts was arrested at work earlier Wednesday at the FBI's training facility in nearby Quantico, Virginia.   Pitts, 43, of Spotsylvania, Virginia, was charged with attempted espionage, conspiracy to commit espionage, communication of classified information, and conveyance without authority of government property. Of slight build and with brown hair, Pitts showed no emotion as the judge informed him of his rights and the maximum penalty in the case, which is life imprisonment or the death penalty if certain conditions are met. Court documents alleged that Pitts conspired with Russian spies from July 1987 through the present -- although he went into a "dormant" capacity in 1992 -- and that he received more than $224,000 from the Russians. The documents said Pitts gave the Russians sensitive classified documents related to the national defense and personal, medical, and family information about fellow FBI agents, as well as proposed strategies by which the Russians might recruit additional agents.
83167>>0>> Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh called a news conference Wednesday to announce that an FBI agent has been accused of spying for Russia, federal officials said. They said the agent, who worked at the FBI facility in nearby Quantico, Virginia, was arrested on Wednesday.   The officials said the suspect, an FBI agent since 1983, worked on national security matters -- catching spies -- at FBI headquarters and at the FBI office in New York. The agent most recently had been transferred to the FBI training facility in Quantico after falling under suspicion, they said. It was not known how long the alleged spying had been going on or how serious the damage had been as a result of the classified documents allegedly passed to Moscow. The revelation of the new spy case followed the arrest last month of a CIA officer, Harold Nicholson, on charges of spying for Russia. The news conference at 2:30 P.M. (1930 GMT) at FBI headquarters will concern "a major development in a significant criminal case," the FBI and Justice Department said in a brief statement. The two agencies said there also would be an initial appearance in the case at 1 P.M. (1800 GMT) before a federal judge in nearby Alexandria, Virginia.
83167>>0>> An Egyptian court ordered on Wednesday an Egyptian man suspected of spying for Israel detained for another 45 days, security sources said. Egyptian security sources have said Emadeddin Abdel Hamid has confessed to spying for Israel and receiving espionage equipment from Azam Azam, an Israeli also detained in Egypt on the same charges. Azam and two Israeli women are charged with recruiting Abdel Hamid to spy for Israel's intelligence service Mossad. Israel insists that Azam, of Arab origin, is innocent and demands his release. Azam, 35, chief mechanic at an Israeli-owned textile factory in Egypt, was arrested in Cairo last month by security authorities along with Abdel Hamid. The official charge sheet detailing accusations against the two men and two women is ready and will be announced any time, an Egyptian public prosecution source said. Egypt in 1979 became the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel but ties have cooled sharply since right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June.
83167>>0>> General Motors Corp on Wednesday denied a press report that it was poised to make a fresh effort to settle its dispute with Volkswagen AG, saying discussions with VW were neither taking place nor planned. A Zurich-based spokesman for the giant U.S. carmaker, which has been feuding bitterly for over three years with VW over alleged industrial espionage, told Reuters: "There are no talks taking place and none are planned." The Wall Street Journal Europe earlier cited sources close to GM as saying that talks between the car giants were expected to resume quickly and a settlement could soon follow. VW said it did not wish to comment on the report. VW and GM are clashing over allegations that GM's former purchasing manager Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua stole company secrets when he switched from GM to VW in 1993. Lopez faces a grand jury investigation by prosecutors in Detroit -- proceedings VW hopes to avoid by reaching an out-of-court settlement. Attempts at reconciliation have so far failed as VW has not met GM's conditions, which are that it sever ties with Lopez, admit wrongdoing and pay damages. VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech last week expressed his "deepest regrets" for the events surrounding the dispute but said he would not apologise directly. GM said his statement was not enough. German press reports last week said top executives from VW and GM would meet this week to try to resolve the crisis. The daily Die Welt reported that VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen and Lower Saxony state premier Gerhard Schroeder would meet with GM executives John Smale and Thomas Wyman. The newspaper also said VW might attempt to win GM over to an out-of-court settlement by offering to help the U.S. carmaker develop business in China -- a country where VW already has a strong presence. Lopez quit VW in late November to prepare his legal defence, but VW has said it may still work with Lopez on consulting projects. Lopez's problems would not be entirely averted even if a deal were made with GM. German prosecutors have filed criminal charges against him and three other executives for embezzlement and betrayal of corporate secrets. If convicted in Germany, the defendents could face up to five years in prison, although legal experts have said first-time offenders rarely face custodial sentences. Lopez has appealed for the U.S. civil lawsuit to be delayed to give him more time to defend himself against the criminal charges he faces in Germany. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

83167>>0>> Russia said on Thursday it had no comment to make on the arrest of a U.S. agent on charges of spying for Moscow but warned against any attempt to use the incident to harm relations between the two countries. The FBI arrested its own agent, Earl Edwin Pitts, on Wednesday for allegedly selling U.S. security secrets to Russia since 1987 for more than $224,000 in the second spy case to erupt in a month. "I have no statement to make and no information on this incident but I want to say that we are firmly opposed...to all attempts at artificially complicating relations between Russia and the United States," Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Demurin told a regular news briefing. "We support the constructive development of relations between our two countries," he added. The FBI said the arrest of Pitts, a 13-year veteran, capped a 16-month undercover operation, with U.S. agents posing as Russian spies and the use of a former Russian officer at the United Nations in New York who later became an FBI informant. It marked the second spy case to rock Washington and Moscow in a month. On November 18 the FBI arrested veteran CIA officer Harold Nicholson on charges of spying for Russia. Itar-Tass news agency on Thursday quoted Vyacheslav Trubnikov, the head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, as saying he suspected a political motive in its public unmasking of alleged Russian agents by the United States. "The overwhelming majority of such publications about the activity of Russian foreign intelligence carry specific political aims and have only an indirect relation to the intelligence itself," Tass quoted Trubnikov as saying. He added that some circles abroad objected to Russia pursuing a more vigorous foreign policy, referring to Moscow's more nationalist stance in recent years after the initial euphoria that accompanied the fall of Soviet communism. Earlier this week Russia itself complained of foreign espionage activity on its soil, saying it posed a major threat to national security despite the end of the Cold War. The chief of the Federal Security Service (FSB), successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said his organisation had exposed some 400 employees of foreign intelligence organisations and 39 Russian citizens working for them in the past two years alone. The FSB has also uncovered more than 100 attempts by Russian citizens to pass on intelligence to foreign organisations on their own initiative, Nikolai Kovalyov told reporters. Trubnikov said it would be hypocritical for Russia to say it would cease all intelligence activity in foreign countries, including the United States. "Not a single, self-respecting state can exist without a secret service," Tass quoted him as saying. "But there's no need to make drama out of this axiom."
83167>>0>> Jailed FBI agent Earl Edwin Pitts will plead not guilty to charges of selling classified information to Russia and seek pre-trial release on bail, his court-appointed lawyer said on Thursday. "He is innocent and is going to enter a plea of not guilty," the lawyer, Nina Ginsberg, said in a telephone interview with Reuters. She said she would seek to have bail set for Pitts, a 13-year veteran of the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested on Wednesday after a 16-month undercover investigation. Meanwhile, Justice Department spokesman John Russell said a federal grand jury in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, Virginia formally indicted Pitts late on Thursday. A copy of the indictment was not immediately available. Ginsberg described Pitts, 43, as being in a "somber" mood when she visited him in jail on Wednesday in Alexandria, where he was being held until at least his next court appearance. Russell said a bail hearing for Pitts, which had been tentatively set for Friday, was now scheduled for Monday. Ginsberg said she asked the judge to postpone it because she needed more time to prepare. "I expect to defend Mr Pitts with every available defence; every possible right that he has, he will have the benefit of it," said Ginsberg, who has practiced criminal law for 17 years. She said she had not yet decided whether to ask the judge to appoint an additional lawyer or investigator to help her with the case. The government has alleged that Pitts began to spy for the former Soviet Union in 1987 while working in the New York FBI unit responsible for catching KGB spies. An FBI affadavit alleged he had given up "everything" he could to Moscow from 1987 to 1992, for at least $224,000. FBI Director Louis Freeh told a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing: "I would not underestimate the seriousness of the damage" allegedly caused by Pitts. Freeh said Russian intelligence had escalated its efforts to spy on the United States, especially in economic espionage. "I think that (Russian) aggression has been unabated even in the post-Cold War. It's escalating. It's a serious problem. It's a continuing problem," said Freeh, whose agency is responsible for catching spies in the United States. Freeh said at least 23 foreign intelligence services were targeting the United States and its economic infrastructure. But he said U.S. counter-intelligence efforts had improved, which might be one reason why spies in the CIA and FBI have been uncovered. The arrest of Pitts on Wednesday came exactly a month after agents took into custody Harold Nicholson, the highest-ranking CIA official to be charged with spying for Russia. Justice Department spokesman Russell said a new grand jury indictment of Nicholson also was handed up late on Thursday. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said money appeared to be the main motive behind the recent spy cases. "It's a sad and tragic event to see these Americans who are selling out their country for financial gain. That seems to be the motivating factor in this new era ... selling out your country for just a pittance," he told a news conference. Attorney General Janet Reno vowed at her weekly Justice Department news briefing to conduct a thorough review of the Pitts case to determine whether further steps must be taken.

83167>>0>> U.S. investigators on Thursday tried to assess the full extent of the damage caused by a veteran FBI agent accused of selling national security secrets to Russian intelligence agencies. FBI Director Louis Freeh, responding to questions at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, said the damage assessment was incomplete involving Earl Edwin Pitts, a 13-year agent who faces espionage charges. "I would not underestimate the seriousness of the damage," Freeh said. Pitts, 43, whose alleged espionage began while he worked in the New York FBI unit responsible for catching Russian spies, was charged with passing along "everything" he could to Moscow from 1987 to 1992, for more than $224,000.

The FBI said the arrest of Pitts capped a 16-month undercover operation, with U.S. agents posing as Russian spies and the use of a former Russian official at the United Nations in New York who later became an FBI informant. Sen. Arlen Specter, the chairman of the intelligence committee, said he believed Pitts caused considerable damage. "But the full extent of the damage won't be known for some time," the Pennsylvania Republican said. Specter told NBC's "Today" programme he was satisfied with the security checks the U.S. government had in place while it pursued Pitts. FBI officials have described it as the most serious spy case since Aldrich Ames, a confessed CIA turncoat arrested in 1994 for betraying numerous agents and passing along some of the nation's most sensitive secrets. "The FBI and the CIA both are very sensitive now to spies. After the Aldrich Ames case, a great deal is being done that wasn't being done before," said Specter. "They're working very hard."

But it is entirely conceivable that there are more spies and they're trying very hard to ferret them out." FBI Director Louis Freeh said on Wednesday the Pitts case did not appear to be as damaging as that involving Aldrich Ames, the confessed CIA turncoat arrested in 1994 for betraying numerous agents and passing along some of the nation's most sensitive secrets. The Pitts incident was the second spy case to rock Washington and Moscow in a month. The FBI on Nov. 18 arrested veteran CIA officer Harold Nicholson on charges of spying for Russia.
83167>>0>> The government said on Friday it may seek the death penalty in the case of former CIA station chief Harold Nicholson on the basis of newly disclosed evidence in the espionage case against him. At a federal court hearing in Alexandria, Virginia, on an abortive fresh defence motion for bail, prosecutors described the potentially highly incriminating evidence as including 10 rolls of undeveloped film containing dozens of highly classified documents relating to Russia and still-uncracked coded messages on a computer disk. Nicholson, the highest ranking Central Intelligence Agency officer ever to face espionage charges, is accused of selling national security secrets to Moscow for 29 months until his Nov. 16 arrest at Dulles Airport outside Washington. "The United States is still reviewing the numerous documents Nicholson attempted to pass on November 16, 1996 to determine whether any meet the statutory requirements for the death penalty," prosecutors said in a memorandum opposing the renewed bail request. In announcing Nicholson's indictment on Nov. 21, U.S. Attorney Helen Fahey, who has overall responsibility for the prosecution, said statutory conditions for the death sentence had not been met "based on the state of the investigation to date." At that time, she said Nicholson, a 16-year CIA veteran, faced life imprisonment without parole if convicted. Under U.S. espionage statutes, the death penalty may be imposed if death resulted from the crime or if the defendant gave away the most sensitive national security secrets such as spy satellite or nuclear weapons technology. Assistant U.S. Attorney Rob Chesnut, who is leading the prosecution, told the court that U.S. experts had not yet cracked the "45- or 65-character code" used to encrypt the computer disk he said had been found along with the film rolls in a lead-lined carry-on bag. Nicholson was arrested by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents as he prepared to fly to Zurich, allegedly to meet with Russian spymasters who paid him more than $180,000. Chief U.S. District Court Judge James Cacheris rejected the defence request to revoke a magistrate's order that Nicholson be held without bail until his trial. He ruled that, now that Nicholson faces possible execution if convicted, he has an even stronger incentive to flee and would pose "an unacceptable danger" to the community if released. Cacheris agreed to a defence request to delay the start of Nicholson's trial so his court-appointed lawyers could have more time to prepare. He set a trial date of April 14, two weeks sooner than they had sought but later than March 10, when the trial was originally due to begin. The possibility that the government could seek the death penalty may increase pressure on Nicholson to cooperate in assessments of the national security harm he allegedly caused. Aldrich Ames, a confessed CIA turncoat, was sentenced to life imprisonment in April 1994 as part of a deal under which he admitted betraying Soviet and East Bloc spies who were secretly on the U.S. payroll. The government said at least 10 of those agents were later killed or disappeared. As part of the deal, Ames' wife Rosario, who pleaded guilty with him, was jailed for at least four years, less than might have otherwise been the case. At the hearing, prosecutors disclosed they had arranged to move Nicholson, 46, from Alexandria City Jail, where has been detained since his arrest, to a more secure local facilty that they did not identify. Liam O'Grady, one of Nicholson's two co-lead counsels, opposed the move as an attempt to isolate him from the company of other inmates. Among those currently being held at the Alexandria jail with Nicholson was Earl Edwin Pitts, a 43-year-old FBI supervisor arrested on Wednesday on charges of selling spy-catching secrets to Moscow for at least $224,000.
83167>>0>> A U.S. federal grand jury has indicted FBI agent Earl Edwin Pitts on 12 counts of spying for Russia and related crimes, the Justice Department said on Friday. The indictment by the grand jury meeting in Alexandria, Virginia, was returned and announced on Thursday, and details were released on Friday. Pitts, 43, was arrested on Wednesday. The indictment charged Pitts, a 13-year FBI veteran, with conspiracy to commit espionage, attempted espionage, communication of classified information without authority and conveyance without authority of U.S. property. According to the indictment, Pitts allegedly began providing counterintelligence information to the Soviet Union's intelligence service, the KGB, in 1987 while he was assigned to the FBI's New York office. The indictment alleged that Pitts provided a wide range of sensitive, classified information to the KGB and its Russian successor organisation and received substantial sums of money in return. It alleged he continued his activities after he was assigned to the Washington FBI office in 1989 and engaged in attempted espionage and other crimes until his arrest. If convicted, Pitts faces a maximum penalty of life in prison on the espionage conspiracy and each of the attempted espionage charges, 10 to 15 years in prison on each of the other charges and a $250,000 fine on each count of the indictment. Pitts is scheduled to appear in federal court on Monday for a detention hearing and for arraignment on Dec. 30. Pitts' lawyer Nina Ginsberg said Thursday: "He is innocent and is going to enter a plea of not guilty." She said she would seek to have Pitts released on bail.
83167>>0>> The Stuttgart public prosecutors' office said on Tuesday it had dropped an investigation into top managers at Daimler-Benz AG because it had found no evidence that they misled shareholders. The office started an investigation after a shareholder filed a legal complaint alleging Daimler executives withheld negative information about the group's financial health at an annual general meeting in May 1995. Edzard Reuter, then chief executive, had forecast at the meeting that profits would rise by a third in 1995 whereas the group went on to post the biggest company loss in German history -- 5.7 billion marks ($3.7 billion) -- for the year. That loss was linked to a big restructuring launched by Reuter's successor, Juergen Schrempp. But the prosecutors' office said Daimler had not breached German shareholder law. Executives found guilty of deliberately misleading shareholders can be sentenced to upto three years in jail. "The investigation has not confirmed the accusation of a deliberate false presentation of the company's economic condition," the prosecutors' office said in a statement. "Losses of the stated extent were not yet foreseeable for the management nor the supervisory board in May 1995." The shareholder's complaint had been directed against Reuter, Schrempp, chief financial officer Manfred Gentz and supervisory board chairman Hilmar Kopper. Investors welcomed the news, which helped push up Daimler's share price by 2.05 marks to 102.75. The company said in a statement it had never doubted that the management painted an accurate picture of the company at the time. But the affair has not been fully resolved yet. Germany's securities trading watchdog said on Friday it would again investigate whether Daimler breached a share trading law by making the profit forecast. A spokesman for the Federal Securities Trading Supervisory Authority Office said the office would examine documents handed over by the prosecutors. The office had already investigated the matter in 1995 but had found no evidence of any breach of rules. Daimler-Benz said in a statement it was taking a "relaxed view" of the new probe. The prosecutor's office said losses that had arisen in the first quarter of 1995, which Daimler did not publish, merely indicated the risk that Daimler may post a loss of 0.3 billion marks for the full year. Withholding the first-quarter loss and the risk it entailed did not breach German shareholder law, the office said. Despite the first-quarter loss, the management board saw no need to correct the profit forecast it had made because it expected to be able to compensate during the rest of the year, following the trend of previous years, the office said. Extrapolating a full-year outlook from the first-quarter loss would have amounted to a highly uncertain forecast because of exchange rate volatility at the time, the office said. The management board had assumed earnings to improve by the end of 1995 amid an expected appreciation of the dollar, the office said. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525 ($ = 1.557 German Marks)
83167>>0>> Former Volkswagen executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua said on Friday his new consulting firm will continue to cooperate with the German car group. In a interview published on Friday by the Spanish daily "El Pais" Lopez said his new firm and Volkswagen will be "complementary". Lopez announced earlier this week he will set up a new consulting firm, "Arriortua and Company", with operating branches in Madrid, Barcelona, German and Brazil. Lopez is accused by his former employer General Motors of taking company secrets to VW in March 1993. Lopez has been charged by German prosecutors along with three others. He is accused of stealing secrets including plans for a new factory in Spain and documents for a new car. He resigned from VW in November to prepare his defence. Lopez said in the interview his main professional hope is to start a car factory in his natal town in Amorebieta. -- Madrid Newsroom, + 341 585 8340

83167>>0>> The Egyptian military prosecutor will handle the case against an Egyptian arrested on suspicion of spying for Israel, security sources said on Saturday. "The military prosecution has received the papers of Samir Osman's case," a source told Reuters. Osman, 47, was arrested last month on suspicion of selling military information to Mossad, the Israeli secret service. According to details given then by the government newspaper al-Ahram, Osman met Mossad agents in Greece, Turkey and Hungary or by swimming to Israel underwater with scuba diving equipment from the border resort of Taba. Osman was a diver during his service at the naval forces. Osman was said to have confessed to providing Mossad with information about the Egyptian navy and about the place where he served in the Egyptian military. "The military prosecution will review Osman's file to issue the charge sheet detailing accusations against him," the security source said. Osman's case is not linked to that of Israeli textile engineer Azam Azam, who was arrested on November 5 on suspicion of spying on Egypt for his country. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he was pressing Egypt to release Azam. The security source said the official charge sheet detailing accusations against Azam and his alleged partners likely would be made public in the next few days.
83167>>0>> German car maker Volkswagen AG, locked in a dispute over industrial espionage with U.S. group General Motors Corp, at the weekend denied planning to file a lawsuit against its rival in the U.S. "We have definitely not reached a decision on filing a law suit against GM," VW spokesman Kurt Ripholz told Reuters in answer to a query, dismissing a report in Saturday's edition of the Sueddeutsche Zeitung that such a suit would be filed soon. The two groups are clashing over allegations that GM's former purchasing manager Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua stole company secrets when he switched from GM to VW in 1993. Lopez faces a grand jury investigation by prosecutors in Detroit -- proceedings VW hopes to avoid by reaching an out-of-court settlement. Attempts at reconciliation have however so far failed as VW has not met GM's conditions, which are that it sever ties with Lopez, admit wrongdoing and pay damages. --Svea Herbst-Bayliss, Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> A federal judge on Monday denied bail for FBI agent Earl Pitts, who was charged last week with spying for the Soviet Union and Russia. "There is substantial reason to believe the defendant would want to flee if released," U.S. District Judge Rawles Jones said in denying a motion for bail by Pitts' attorney. The judge also said the release of the spy suspect would be a threat to national security. Pitts, 43, appeared at the bail hearing in U.S. District Court, but did not speak. FBI Agent David Lambert testified at the bail hearing that an escape plan was found in a computer in Pitts' office in 1995 when the FBI had him under surveillance. But under questioning from Pitts' attorney, Nina Ginsberg, Lambert said Pitts turned down three offers from FBI agents posing as Russian spies to give him a false passport Pitts was scheduled to be arraigned next week and is expected to plead not guilty. No trial date has been set. The 13-year veteran of the FBI was arrested last Wednesday and charged with spying for the Soviet KGB and its Russian successor intelligence agency, the SVRR. Pitts was indicted by a federal grand jury on 12 counts of spying for Russia and related crimes. He was charged with conspiracy to commit espionage, attempted espionage, communication of classified information without authority and conveyance without authority of U.S. property. If convicted, Pitts faces a maximum penalty of life in prison on the espionage conspiracy and each of the attempted espionage charges, 10 to 15 years in prison on each of the other charges and a $250,000 fine on each count of the indictment. The indictment alleged that Pitts began providing counter-intelligence information to the Soviet Union's intelligence service, the KGB, in 1987 while he was assigned to the FBI's New York office and that he continued his activities after he was assigned to the Washington FBI office in 1989. It alleged that Pitts provided a wide range of sensitive, classified information to the KGB and its Russian successor organisation in return for substantial sums of money. Pitts received from the KGB and its Russian successor, the SVRR, at least $224,000 through October, 1992, when he became "dormant," prosecutors charged. Earlier Harold Nicholson, a 16-year Central Intelligence Agency veteran, was accused of selling Moscow national security secrets for 29 months until his Nov. 16 arrest. U.S. officials made clear following his arrest that Pitts' alleged sellout did far less damage to U.S. security than Nicholson's or that of Aldrich Ames, a 31-year CIA veteran who confessed in April 1994 to unmasking dozens of Soviet and other agents secretly in U.S. pay.
83167>>0>> China has jailed a Tibetan music expert touring the Himalayan region on a U.S. scholarship for 18 years for spying in one of the harshest sentences ever meted out in the restive region, local radio reported on Friday. Ngawang Choephel, 30, who was travelling in Tibet as a Fulbright scholar to produce an amateur documentary about traditional music and dance, was detained by the authorities in Tibet in August, 1995, said the broadcast monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. The young scholar confessed to having been sent to Tibet by "the Dalai (Lama) clique" on behalf of an unnamed foreign country to conduct espionage activities, the report said in a thinly veiled reference to the United States. U.S. officials had no immediate comment on the case. He was visiting "under the pretext of collecting information on Tibetan folk songs and dances", the radio broadcast said. "In accordance with the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China... The Intermediate People's Court of Xigaze Prefecture sentenced Ngawang Choephel to an 18-year prison term for committing espionage crime," the radio said. He was deprived of his political rights for four years. China has been swift to crack down on any sign of anti-Chinese unrest in the Himalayan region. Beijing has been especially nervous about anyone with possible links to the exiled Dalai Lama, Tibet's god-king, since he announced in 1995 his own candidate as the reincarnation of the region's second holiest monk, the Panchen Lama. China later presided over the discovery of an alternative reincarnation. "The striking thing is the length of the sentence," Robbie Barnett of the London-based group Tibet Information Network said in a telephone interview. "It is quite extraordinary." Ngawang Choephol's sentence was the most severe handed down in a political case since Tibetan monk Ngawang Phulchung was jailed for 19 years in 1989 for subversion after publishing political leaflets, including a manifesto for a democratic Tibet. Another monk, Jampel Changchup, was also sentenced in 1989 to 19 years in prison for subversion and espionage. "It does seem to be a provocative decision in political terms because it names three times 'a certain foreign government'," Barnett said. "It appears to mean the end of any sense that China is susceptible to the international community on human rights issues," he said. "They now feel confident to use counter-espionage laws against political offenders." Ngawang Choephol left Tibet as a child shortly after the Chinese takeover in 1950 and grew up in India before going to Middlebury College in Vermont in 1993 as a Fulbright scholar in ethnomusicology. The young man, who once worked as a dance teacher in India, travelled to Tibet in 1995 to make his amateur documentary. To gain permission to travel to his birthplace, Ngawang Choephol renounced his Indian refugee status and entered Tibet as a Chinese citizen, Barnett said. He was last reported to have been seen in Nyari prison in Xigaze, Tibet's second largest city in the west of the Himalayan region, in September 1995, shortly after his arrest in the local market. "It is very unlikely that he was a spy," said Barnett. "He was genuinely making the film he said he was making. No one wold have entrusted him to do this because he was not competent to carry out any hidden activities. "He is a rather distracted, emotional artist," he said.
83167>>0>> The United States said on Friday it was concerned at China's reported sentencing of a Tibetan-born former Fulbright scholar to 18 years in prison on espionage charges. "The United States is quite concerned" about the reported prison term handed down to Ngawang Choephel, 30, who was detained by Chinese authorities in Tibet in 1995, State Department spokesman John Dinger told reporters. The United States knew nothing of his activities other than making a documentary, Dinger said. "We have no independent information that he was in fact involved in any other activities" than videotaping the documentary about Tibet's traditional music and dance, he said. Ngawang Choephel studied ethnomusicology at Middlebury College in Vermont in 1992-93 as a Fulbright scholar, an international educational exchange programme funded by the U.S. Information Agency. The International Campaign for Tibet, a Washington-based group that monitors human rights, said he had been filming a documentary about traditional Tibetan music and dance that he feared would be lost because of alleged Chinese efforts to dilute local culture. He was arrested in a market in Shigatse, Tibet, on or about Sept. 15, 1995. Contrary to some published reports, he had not been travelling as a Fulbright scholar at the time of his arrest, Dinger said. "I think I can assure you he was not there under U.S. auspices -- certainly not a Fulbright scholar -- and to the best of my knowledge he was not there on any other activities connected to the United States." A Chinese radio report monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation said Ngawang Choephel had confessed to having been sent to Tibet by "the Dalai (Lama) clique" on behalf of an unnamed foreign country to conduct espionage activities. In an Oct. 15 letter to members of Congress who had asked about Ngawang Choephel's disappearance, Chinese Ambassdor to the United States Li Daoyou alleged that the Tibetan, "funded by some Americans" and posing as a film maker, had been gathering intelligence and fostering "illegal separatist activities." China frequently accuses the Dalai Lama, the spiritual and political leader of more than 6 million Tibetans and winner of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize, of fomenting anti-Chinese revolt in Tibet, which Chinese troops entered in large numbers in 1950. The State Department repeated that it was concerned about the preservation of Tibet's unique cultral, linguistic and religious heritage. In addition, the department said it was continuing to urge the Chinese authorities to release all those held for the peaceful expression of their political or religious views. The International Campaign for Tibet dismissed Ngawang Choephel's reported confession as insignificant because of possible duress. "Everyone knows that all confessions are imposed" in China and Tibet, said Bhuchung Tsering, a spokesman for the campaign in Washington.
83167>>0>> Qatar said a decision on Saturday by Bahrain to pardon two Qataris convicted of spying could help improve relations between the two Gulf Arab neighbours. "We welcome the good news and believe the gesture will help clear the mist of mistrust between our two countries," a senior Qatari official told Reuters.. Bahrain's Emir Sheikh Issa bin Sulman al-Khalifa pardoned Fahad Hamad Abdullah al-Baker and Salwa Jassim Mohammed Fakhri. A state security court on Wednesday had sentenced the two Qataris to three years in jail and fined them 1,000 dinars ($2,652) each for spying for Qatar. The case had raised tensions between Bahrain and Qatar, already strained by a territorial dispute over small islands in the Gulf controlled by Bahrain since the 1930s but also claimed by Qatar. "The emiri decree includes dropping all their penalties and releasing them," Bahrain Cabinet and Information Minister Mohammad Ibrahim al-Mutawae said in a statement sent to Reuters. Mutawae said the pardon followed an appeal to Sheikh Isa in which the two Qataris "regretted their acts against Bahrain and sought clemency." The Bahraini minister said the pardon was part of Sheikh Isa's initiatives to maintain good relations between the peoples of Bahrain and Qatar. "We were expecting their release because we were sure that they were innocent and their trial was simply for political considerations," said the Qatari official. "Now, we hope things will improve and the two neighbours will concentrate on solving their outstanding problems in a brotherly spirit," he added. Qatar on Wednesday demanded the immediate release of the two men. Qatar had also accused Bahrain of torturing al-Baker and said the trial "sets a dangerous precedent in Gulf's ties". Bahrain denied the charge. Qatar had taken their long-standing border dispute to the International Court of Justice in the Hague in 1991. The move angered Bahrain, which prefers a regional solution. The dispute prompted Bahrain to boycott a two-day summit of leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) which ended in the Qatari capital Doha on December 9. The GCC, a political and economic alliance, also groups Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. It decided to form a committee to resolve the dispute. Foreign ministers of the GCC attending a meeting in Cairo on Saturday were expected to discuss the problem.

"It's high time that these two companies let themselves be ruled by their responsibilities to their organisations and not by legal tactics," Zwickel said.

83167>>0>> The incursion of a North Korean submarine, for which Pyongyang on Sunday apologised, was one of many deadly infiltrations since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Following is a chronology of the major incidents: Jan 21, 1968 - Thirty-one armed North Korean agents almost reach the gates of the presidential Blue House in Seoul, 28 are killed in a fierce gunbattle in which 34 South Korean troops, police and civilians also die. Oct 30, 1968 - A total of 130 armed North Koreans slip in through the east coast areas of Uljin and Samchok. Some 110 are killed after exchanges of gunfire in which 70 Southern troops and civilians also die. Seven are captured. June 12, 1969 - North Korean espionage vessel with 15 people on board sails into remote southeast island of Huksando. All infiltrators are killed in a gunbattle. April 4, 1970 - North Korean espionage vessel infiltrates tiny western island of Gyokyolbiyoldo. South Korean troops kill 17 agents. June 21, 1981 - South Korean armed forces destroy North Korean espionage vessel off west coast city of Sosan, killing nine and capturing one alive. May 22, 1992 - Three armed North Koreans infiltrate just south of the inter-Korean border. All are shot and killed. Oct 24, 1995 - A North Korean spy is captured and his companion is killed in clash with security forces in southern city of Puyo. They had landed on the southern island of Cheju aboard a midget submarine on September 2. Sept 18, 1996 - North Korean Shark-class submarine is spotted by taxi driver stranded off beach near Kangnung on South Korea's east coast shortly after midnight. After massive manhunt using helicopters, sniffer dogs and up to 60,000 troops, 24 infiltrators that landed from the vessel are killed, one is captured alive and one was still on the loose.
83167>>0>> Ferdinand Piech, chief executive of Volkswagen AG, should apologise to General Motors Corp, Klaus Zwickel, chairman of German union IG Metall, said in an interview with a German Sunday newspaper. Zwickel, who is a member of Volkswagen's supervisory board, said that the two carmakers, currently involved in a bitter legal dispute, should settle their differences.   "I would apologise and try to put a halt to this legal avalanche," Zwickel said in an interview in Sunday's Bild am Sonntag, when he was asked what he would do were he chief executive of Volkswagen. VW and U.S. carmaker GM are clashing over allegations that GM's former purchasing manager Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua stole company secrets when he switched from GM to VW in 1993. Zwickel said that VW had profited greatly from Lopez's experience and that Lopez had given production at VW a big boost -- and that the supervisory board had no interest in industrial espionage.   "The VW supervisory board wanted Lopez because of his great experience, not for the possibility of engaging in industrial espionage," Zwickel said. The union chief said that the ongoing legal battle was unsettling employees at both Volkswagen and at GM's German car-making unit Adam Opel AG. "The employees in both companies want to make cars, not to see a legal wrangle. For over 150,000 people at VW and Opel, car manufacture is their reason for living," said Zwickel.   "It's high time that these two companies let themselves be ruled by their responsibilities to their organisations and not by legal tactics," Zwickel said. "The competition between the two companies has to be based on the quality of the products they make, not on the quality of their lawyers," the union chief said. Zwickel went on to say that the decision by GM to implement legal proceedings in the U.S. against VW had taken the German carmaker by surprise. Asked if the VW supervisory board would continue to support Piech, Zwickel said: "Piech has been a major asset to Volkswagen and he remains a major asset. Nothing has changed on that front." -- Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said European economic and monetary union (EMU) could help Germany fight high unemployment and other economic problems. In an article appearing in Tuesday's Handelsblatt newspaper, Rexrodt said he still expected German economic growth to rebound to 2.5 percent this year, but added this was no reason for complacency. "With a large measure of price stability and solid state finances, EMU will strengthen the German economy in international competition and lead to more growth and employment over the long term," he said. The task of lowering government debt and deficit levels to qualify for EMU is one that would face Germany and other European governments even without the prospect of a single currency, he said. Rexrodt said the "short-term technical questions of currency conversion" required quick solutions. "The goal is a low-cost and competitively neutral currency conversion without superfluous regulatory requirements, but with a high degree of legal security," he said. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) sees 1996 growth in Germany's gross domestic product at 1.1 percent, but most private sector economists expect it to be about 1.5 percent.

83167>>0>> General Motors Corp on Friday asked a U.S. federal judge deny a request to delay its industrial espionage lawsuit against Volkswagen AG and its former production chief, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. GM filed a motion asking U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds to deny a request by Lopez' lawyers for a postponement until separate criminal investigations in the United States and Germany were resolved. On December 10, German prosecutors charged Lopez and three others with misappropriating trade secrets from GM and its Adam Opel AG unit in Germany.   Lopez, who abruptly left GM to join Volkswagen in 1993 along with several other executives, resigned from VW's management board in late November and is believed to be living in his native Spain. Lopez' lawyers claim that he cannot effectively defend himself in two cases simultaneously and would risk incriminating himself by responding to GM's civil allegations. GM's motion claims that Lopez' request for a stay has no legal standing. "They filed their motion in one more effort to delay the case, and we are opposing it," GM spokesman John Mueller said.   Edmunds has scheduled a hearing for January 29, when oral arguments on the postponement issue will be presented.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG will soon introduce a new mini-car in a bid to prove that small vehicles can be built profitably in Germany, according to a newspaper. The Frankfurt Allgemeine Zeitung reported Saturday that VW will soon unveil the VW Lupino, which is slated to be offered to the public during 1997. VW, Europe's largest carmaker, will also offer a similar vehicle from its Spanish subsidiary SEAT, which will be called the "Arosa." It will be introduced before the VW version. The SEAT version of the four-seat vehicle, which is based on a shortened platform of the subcompact VW Polo but uses the same engine, will cost about 17,000 marks ($11,000). The better-equipped Lupino will be more expensive, the newspaper said. A spokesman for Wolfsburg-based VW was not available over the weekend to comment on the new vehicle, which is the developed version of a concept car first shown at the 1991 Frankfurt auto show. The newspaper said VW wanted to build the vehicle at its Wolfsburg plant to demonstrate that small vehicles can be made in Germany at a profit despite the country's higher wage costs and also to take advantage of excess production capacity. The new vehicle can be built in about seven hours, which is about half the prodution time of the subcompact VW polo and about a quarter of the time needed to build the popular VW Golf, the newspaper said. The vehicle relies heavily on new work practices as well as heavy outsourcing of parts and materials to reduce costs and production time, according to the newspaper report.

83167>>0>> Automakers Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp. said on Thursday they had reached a settlement resolving the dispute stemming from alleged industrial espionage by former executive Jose Ignacio Lopez. In a joint statement, the firms said they had "reached a settlement agreement on all civil disputes relating to the Lopez matter between the companies in Germany and the United States." The settlement includes an "arrangement" under which VW will pay General Motors $100 million. VW also has committed itself to enter into supply contracts to buy GM parts worth $1 billion over a period of seven years. As part of the settlement, GM and its German subsidiary Adam Opel AG and Volkswagen will drop all civil litigation against each other or against individuals. That includes a civil action brought against VW in the Detroit Federal Court in March 1996. The statement said the companies expressed satisfaction they were able to settle the dispute and create an appropriate environment to let them look forward to "a future unencumbered by the legacy of this matter." VW also confirmed in a letter sent to GM Thursday that four former GM managers who abruptly moved to VW in 1993 have all either resigned or will take administrative leave. The letter is part of an agreement that resolves a bitter dispute over allegations the executives, including Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, took industrial secrets with them when they moved to VW in 1993. VW has already accepted the resignation of executives Lopez and Gutierrez. Two more executives, Alvarez and Piazza, will resign, or take administrative leave by the end of January, VW said.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp., ending one of the bitterest battles in corporate history, reached an out-of-court settlement Thursday of alleged industrial espionage by GM executives who moved to VW. VW, Europe's largest carmaker, said it had agreed to pay $100 million to GM, whose German unit Adam Opel AG is VW's biggest rival in Europe, and acknowledged there might have been wrongdoing by the individuals who quit GM to join VW in 1993. Both sides agreed to drop all legal actions against each other and VW committed itself to buy GM parts worth $1 billion over a seven-year period. The deal, hammered out in Detroit during secret talks held this week, brought to an end a nearly four-year-old dispute and removed VW from the risk of facing a multi-billion dollar U.S. jury verdict in a civil lawsuit filed by GM last March. Both automakers said in joint statement they looked forward to "a future unencumbered by the legacy of this matter." In a letter to GM that is part of the settlement, VW confirmed that it had accepted the resignation of the figure at the centre of the dispute, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a 55-year-old Spaniard, and also those who followed him to VW. VW, in accepting that GM's actions were "not designed to harm Volkswagen's image," also retracted statements made by company officials that included allegations GM employees may have tampered with evidence later collected by prosecutors. Previous secret talks to end the dispute had failed as the two automakers argued over what public statements had to be made by VW officials to end the fight, industry sources said. VW in 1993 had lured Lopez away from GM and named him to the VW management board. He quickly fulfilled his reputation as a tough cost-cutter by slicing around 1 billion marks ($635 million) out of VW operations, helping the automaker return to profitability. But GM accused him of industrial espionage, alleging he had used GM strategic documents to blunt GM's cost advantage, and filed the Detroit lawsuit after saying the German probe was too slow. The Detroit lawsuit, which named VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech as a defendant, alleged that Lopez stole thousands of GM documents on a new factory, parts data and cost data for GM vehicles and others under development. GM had long held the upper hand in the dispute, repeatedly calling on VW to fire Lopez and his associates as well as to issue a public apology and agree to charges before a settlement deal could be reached -- all fulfilled in the settlement. Lopez resigned from the VW board last November, only a few days before German prosecutors filed criminal charges against him and three of his associates who had followed him to VW. Of those three managers, one has already quit VW and the two others will resign or take administrative leave as part of the settlement announced late on Thursday. VW also said it "acknowledges the possibility that illegal activities by the individuals may have occurred. These allegations remain to be proven or disproven." But VW added that it respected the individuals' right to be considered innocent until proven guilty. VW shares rose in Frankfurt to a record 706.90 marks ($448.50) on speculation that a settlement was imminent.

In a separate letter, VW confirmed to GM that four former GM managers, including Lopez, who moved to VW had all either resigned, or were due to take administrative leave. The letter was part of the agreement resolving the bitter dispute over the allegations that the executives took industrial secrets with them when they moved to VW in 1993. VW has already accepted the resignation of executives Lopez and Jose Manuel Gutierrez. Two more executives, Rosaria Alvarez and Jorge Piazza, will resign, or take administrative leave by the end of January, VW said. In the letter, VW also noted that the four managers were still the subject of a suit brought by German prosecutors in Darmstadt alleging illegal activities. "Therefore, Volkswagen acknowledges the possibility that illegal activities by the individuals may have occurred. These allegations remain to be proven or disproven," it said. For its part, GM said in a letter to VW that it would continue to cooperate fully with the public prosecutors. "General Motors and Opel necessarily will abide by and respect the judgments of the prosecutors and the outcome of their investigations and proceedings," it said. VW spokesman Klaus Kocks told Reuters in response to an inquiry that the company had set aside reserves to cover the payment of $100 million to GM as part of the out-of-court settlement.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG's supervisory board has agreed in principle to settle a nearly four-year-old dispute with General Motors Corp. over allegations of industrial spying, sources close to VW said Thursday. But it has not yet finalised a deal with the world's largest automaker, the sources said. The German automaker's board met for about an hour Thursday and discussed specific proposals to end the dispute over allegations that former VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez stole secrets when he quit GM, according to sources in the Lower Saxony state government, which owns 20 percent of VW. Secret talks between VW and GM, which have centred on VW agreeing to retract statements made about GM and its German subsidiary, Adam Opel AG, have not yet been completed. But sources for both automakers said an out-of-court settlement between VW and its biggest rival in Europe could be announced as soon as Friday, with both sides apparently wanting to end the dispute without harming their brand images or sales in a lengthy fight. One source close to the talks said there had been "real progress in settlement discussions" since VW was prepared to publicly retract statements that GM and Adam Opel might have manipulated or falsified evidence later collected by German prosecutors. VW has also apparently agreed to retract suggestions by top VW officials that GM had organised an attack against Germany as an economic centre. "This has prepared the basis to go further," the source said. "You can assume the talks are ongoing and are intensive." Previous attempts to end the dispute have failed because VW had refused to retract the statements, according to GM sources. Both automakers declined to comment officially on the talks. But after months of heated exchanges, they made conciliatory noises Thursday as speculation about a possible deal sent VW shares surging on the Frankfurt stock market, where they rose to a record. Hans Wilhelm Gaeb, a vice president at GM's European headquarters in Zurich, said GM was committed to being a "fair player" with VW and reiterated that its dispute targeted a handful of VW officials, not the company itself. "We have always made clear that we have respect for VW. We have not wanted to damage VW as a firm. We had to take the legal action in Detroit to get this issue moved," Gaeb said. VW spokesman Klaus Kocks, who once said he loved to get the blood pressure boiling at GM, welcomed Gaeb's comments. The two automakers began new talks in early January to end the dispute, which is centred on a Detroit federal court lawsuit in which GM charged VW and some top executives with racketeering for luring away Lopez in March 1993. In the suit, which names VW management board Chairman Ferdinand Piech as a defendant, GM alleges Lopez stole thousands of GM documents on a new factory as well as parts data for existing GM vehicles and those under development. Lopez quit the VW management board in late November, a condition set by GM for any settlement talks, shortly before German prosecutors filed criminal charges against him and three other executives accused of bringing the documents to VW. But German prosecutors said they found insufficient evidence of a conspiracy between senior VW managers and Lopez, who could face up to five years in prison if convicted. VW has been under intense pressure to settle the dispute since GM was expected to demand damages of billions of dollars because it claimed Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, used the data to cut 1 billion marks ($635 million) in costs at VW. A lawsuit award by a jury would be tripled under a U.S. racketeering law first used to fight organised crime. The source said GM was still committed to receiving damages, calling it a matter of principle. But the source added: "The amount to be claimed is subject to the atmosphere of the discussions and that the other conditions be met." Sources have said any damages to GM might include a deal for VW to cooperate on joint ventures in emerging markets, such as China, where VW is strong, or for VW to buy parts from GM.

83167>>0>> The dispute over Volkswagen AG's hiring of Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a 55-year-old Spaniard, from General Motors Corp in March 1993 had been going on for nearly four years before the two carmakers on Thursday reached an out-of-court settlement. Following is a chronology of events leading up to the deal: 1992 May - Lopez is named vice president at GM responsible for woldwide purchasing. November - VW makes initial contact with Lopez. 1993 March - Lopez, along with seven of his colleagues, leave GM and its German unit Adam Opel AG to join VW. Lopez is appointed to VW management board in charge of production. April - Opel initiates legal proceedings against Lopez at a court in Darmstadt, near Frankfurt, allegeding industrial espionage to the detriment of Opel and GM. May - Opel tries to issue an employment ban at a Frankfurt regional court, stopping Lopez's colleagues from taking up jobs at VW. The court denies the application, saying there was no legal basis. July - Darmstadt prosecutors widen the scope of their investigation into Lopez and colleagues. Investigators from the state prosecutors' office discover confidential documents from Opel and GM in the Wiesbaden apartment of two former Opel managers who had joined VW. Also in July, U.S. prosecutors in Detroit begin probe against Lopez and his colleagues. Speaking in an interview with Germany's Stern magazine, VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech describes the Lopez affair as "international economic war" against his company. 1994 February - The Frankfurt regional court rejects Opel's plea during a hearing for an employment ban on its former managers now working at VW. May - Opel seeks a warrant against Lopez, saying it had discovered new evidence. 1996 January - The Darmstadt public prosecutors' office ends probe and asks for a statement from Lopez. March - GM and Opel initiate proceedings at a U.S. federal court in Detroit, seeking unspecified damages. The charges are conspiracy and breach of confidentiality. May - VW initiates proceedings of its own in a Frankfurt court for damages to its reputation against GM and Opel based on statements made by company officials at news conferences in March to announce the U.S. lawsuit. June - A German court in Celle requires that VW defend the U.S. court action brought by GM and Opel. July - VW contests GM's damage claims in the U.S. October - Frankfurt court rejects VW's claims of damage to its reputation against GM and Opel. In the United States, the Detroit federal court allows GM's damage claim against Volkswagen, clearing the way for lawyers to preapre for a jury trial. November 8 - Legal sources say an German criminal indictment against Lopez would be filed in 1996. November 11 - Labour court in Braunschweig, Germany, says damage proceedings between the two carmakers would take place in September 1997. November 25 - GM and VW decline to comment on reports of possible secret discussions between the parties on an out-of-court settlement to the Detroit lawsuit. Industry officials also speculated GM might seek billions of dollars in damages from Detroit over the alleged theft of secret documents. November 26 - A U.S. court decides Volkswagen can be prosecuted under a special law governing racketeering first used to fight organised crime and later expanded to business cases. November 27 - GM reaffirms its conditions for any out-of-court settlement to its Detroit lawsuit - Lopez and his associates must leave the German carmaker, VW pay damages and also issue a public apology. November 29 - Lopez resigns from VW management board. December 9 - VW's Piech issues statement saying he has "deepest regrets" for damages done to both VW and GM by the Lopez affair, notes VW was prepared to buy parts from GM instead of paying for damages. GM calls Piech statement insufficient. December 13 - Prosecutors in Darmstadt announce criminal charges against Lopez and three of his associates who followed him to VW from GM in March 1993. Lopez, if convicted, could face up to five years in prison. 1997 Week of January 6 - New round of talks between the two carmakers is repoorted to be under way. January 9 - GM and VW announce out-of-court settlement has been reached and that all civil litigation between the two carmakers and individuals would be dismissed.

83167>>0>> A German newspaper said on Thursday that Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp have agreed to a settlement regarding GM's allegations of industrial spying by the German carmaker. Germany's Handelsblatt newspaper released ahead of publication on Friday an article saying that VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen and GM executive committee chairman John Smale had agreed to the settlement to end the dispute over the transfer of Jose Ignacio Lopez to VW from GM in 1993. GM, which is based in Detroit, charged in its U.S. lawsuit against VW that Lopez stole thousands of secret documents when he left to join VW and used the information to cut more than one billion marks in costs and help VW return to profitability. The newspaper, quoting U.S. legal sources, as saying that VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech was also in Detroit last week but made no public appearances during the North American automobile show. Handelsblatt said the settlement calls for VW to buy car parts from GM companies' under long-term contracts and to pay for GM's legal costs from the nearly four-year legal battle. GM has also dropped its demand that Piech publicly apologise to the U.S. carmaker for the damages incurred by the information taken by Lopez, who faces German criminal charges for allegedly taking along the documents, Handelsblatt said. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

The Detroit lawsuit, which named VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech as a defendant, alleged that Lopez stole thousands of GM documents on a new factory, parts data and cost data for GM vehicles both existing and under development. GM had long held the upper hand in the dispute, repeatedly calling on VW to fire Lopez and his associates as well as to issue a public apology and agree to charges before a settlement deal could be reached -- all fulfilled in the settlement. Lopez resigned from the VW board last November, only a few days before German prosecutors filed criminal charges against him and three of his associates who had followed him to VW. Of those three managers, one has already quit VW and the two others will resign or take administrative leave as part of the settlement announced late on Thursday. VW also said it "acknowledges the possibility that illegal activities by the individuals may have occurred. These allegations remain to be proven or disproven". But VW added that it respected the individuals' right to be considered innocent until proven guilty. VW shares ended 27 marks higher in Frankfurt on Thursday at a record high of 706.90 marks on speculation that a settlement was imminent. ($1=1.5711 Mark)
83167>>0>> Automakers Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp. said on Thursday they had reached a settlement resolving the dispute stemming from alleged industrial espionage by former executive Jose Ignacio Lopez. In a joint statement, the firms said they had "reached a settlement agreement on all civil disputes relating to the Lopez matter between the companies in Germany and the United States."   The settlement includes an "arrangement" under which VW will pay General Motors $100 million. VW also has committed itself to enter into supply contracts to buy GM parts worth $1 billion over a period of seven years. As part of the settlement, GM and its German subsidiary Adam Opel AG and Volkswagen will drop all civil litigation against each other or against individuals. That includes a civil action brought against VW in the Detroit Federal Court in March 1996. The statement said the companies expressed satisfaction they were able to settle the dispute and create an appropriate environment to let them look forward to "a future unencumbered by the legacy of this matter." VW also confirmed in a letter sent to GM Thursday that four former GM managers who abruptly moved to VW in 1993 have all either resigned or will take administrative leave. The letter is part of an agreement that resolves a bitter dispute over allegations the executives, including Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, took industrial secrets with them when they moved to VW in 1993. VW has already accepted the resignation of executives Lopez and Gutierrez. Two more executives, Alvarez and Piazza, will resign, or take administrative leave by the end of January, VW said.

83167>>0>> General Motors Corp. and Volkswagen AG have been holding secret talks to solve their dispute over the U.S. carmaker's claims of industrial spying by its German rival, a legal source told Reuters Thursday. The source, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters there has been "real progress in settlement discussions" in the case over allegations that a former GM executive and his associates stole documents when they left to join VW in 1993. Industry sources said a settlement could be announced as soon as Friday. The talks began in early January, the source said. "It seems as though VW is prepared to publically retract statements that they made some years ago about GM and Opel about having manipulated or falsified evidence," the source said, noting GM has moderated its stance in the dispute. "The other thing which is of equal significance is that they will retract, at least that is their offer, any suggestions that GM or Opel may have run an attack against Germany as an industrial location," the source said of VW. "This has prepared the basis to go further," the source said. "You can assume the talks are going on and are intensive." Hans Wilhelm Gaeb, a vice president at GM's European headquarters Zurich, declined to comment on any talks between the two carmakers. A VW spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment. But Gaeb said GM was committed to being a "fair player" with VW and reiterated that its dispute targeted a handful of current or former VW officials, not the company itself. "We have made clear that we are fair players and not a company that is going to push another competitor to the wall. I think all possiblities are still open," Gaeb told Reuters. "We have always made clear that we have respect for VW. We have not wanted to damage VW as a firm. We had to take the legal action in Detroit to get this issue moved," he said. "It was a way to show this was a serious situation." The source also said GM was still committed to receiving damages, calling it "a matter of principle." But the source added: "The amount to be claimed is subject to the atmosphere of the discussions and that the other conditions be met." GM and Opel have been at legal odds since Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and a group of former executives left GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG, in March 1993 to join VW. GM charged that Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, took along thousands of secret GM documents that helped VW return to profitability and blunted GM's competitive edge. The Detroit carmaker set three guidelines for any settlement talks -- Lopez and those who followed him to GM must leave VW, the German carmaker had to issue a public apology and must also agree to pay for damages. Lopez quit VW in late November, shortly before German prosecutors filed criminal charges against him and three of his associates. Previous attempts to settle the lawsuit GM brought against VW in a Detroit federal court charging the carmaker with racketeering have failed, in part because VW refused to retract statements made by top company officials.

83167>>0>> Volkswagen's supervisory board has agreed in principle to settle a nearly four-year-old dispute with General Motors over allegations of industrial spying, VW board sources said on Thursday. But it has not yet finalised a deal with the U.S. car giant, the supervisory board sources said. The German car maker's board met for about an hour on Thursday and discussed specific proposals to end the dispute over allegations that former VW production guru Jose Ignacio Lopez stole secrets when he quit GM, according to sources in the Lower Saxony state government, which owns 20 percent of VW. Secret talks between VW and GM, which have centred on VW agreeing to retract statements made about GM and its German subsidiary, Adam Opel, have not yet been completed. But sources for both car makers said an out-of-court deal between VW and its biggest rival in Europe could be announced as soon as Friday with both sides apparently wanting to end the dispute without harming brand images or market position by a lengthy fight. One source close to the talks said there had been "real progress in settlement discussions" since VW was now prepared to publicly retract statements that GM and Adam Opel might have manipulated or falsified evidence later collected by German prosecutors. The Wolfsburg-based car maker has also apparently agreed to retract suggestions by top VW officials that GM had organised an attack against Germany as an economic centre. "This has prepared the basis to go further," the source said. "You can assume the talks are ongoing and are intensive." Previous attempts to end the dispute have failed because VW had refused to retract the statements, according to GM sources. Both car makers declined official comment on the talks. But, after months of heated exchanges, they made conciliatory noises on Thursday as speculation about a possible deal sent VW shares surging in Frankfurt bourse dealings. VW shares ended up 27 marks at 706.90, a record high. Hans Wilhelm Gaeb, a vice president at GM's European headquarters in Zurich, said GM was committed to being a "fair player" with VW and reiterated that its dispute targeted a handful of VW officials, not the company itself. "We have always made clear that we have respect for VW. We have not wanted to damage VW as a firm. We had to take the legal action in Detroit to get this issue moved," Gaeb said. VW spokesman Klaus Kocks, who once said he loved to get the blood pressure boiling at GM, welcomed Gaeb's comments. The two car makers began new talks in early January to end the dispute, which is centred on a Detroit federal court lawsuit in which GM charged VW and some top executives with racketeering for luring away Lopez in March 1993. GM charges in the lawsuit, which names VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech as a defendant, that Lopez stole thousands of GM documents on a new factory, parts data and cost data for existing GM vehicles and also those under development. Lopez quit the VW management board in late November, a condition set by GM for any settlement talks, shortly before German prosecutors filed criminal charges against him and three other executives accused of bringing the documents to VW. But German prosecutors said they found insufficient evidence of a conspiracy between senior VW managers and Lopez, who could face up to five years in prison if he were convicted.

83167>>0>> A U.S. lawyer representing former Volkswagen AG purchasing chief Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua said Friday he hopes the settlement between VW and General Motors Corp will help quell the U.S. criminal investigation of Lopez. "It is my hope that this settlement will dampen the ardor of the criminal investigation," attorney Plato Cacheris said. "It's a factor that the U.S. Justice Department should consider."   Cacheris, based in Washington, D.C., said it was a significant step that GM and VW could settle their differences. The two automakers announced Thursday that they had settled their four-year-dispute, dismissing GM's federal racketeering lawsuit against VW, which accused Lopez and others of conspiring to steal corporate secrets when they quit GM to join VW in 1993. VW agreed to pay GM $100 million and committed to boosting its purchases of GM parts by $1 billion over seven years. Both sides exchanged letters expressing "regret" about certain actions and statements. German prosecutors brought criminal charges against Lopez and three others in December.  The U.S. Justice Department's investigation is continuing. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Detroit was not immediately available for comment on the civil settlement.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG boss Ferdinand Piech will remain chief executive following the settlement of VW's dispute with General Motors Corp, the president of the German state of Lower Saxony and VW supervisory board member Gerhard Schroeder said on Friday. "Piech has successfully led the company for three years and he will remain with us," Schroder said in an interview in the Saturday edition of the Koelner Stadt-Anzeiger newspaper, released in advance of publication. A deal was struck on Thursday between Volkswagen and GM's German unit Adam Opel AG over charges that cost-cutting VW production chief Jose Ignacio Lopez stole GM data when he joined VW in 1994 which ended the possibility of a U.S. jury awarding billion-dollar damages against Volkswagen. Schroeder denied that the VW management had acted wrongly in the dispute. "I do not feel damaged in any way. All decisions were agreed unanimously by the VW board and I have no reason to doubt these decisions in hindsight," Schroeder said. Schroeder went on to say that the compromise reached in the dispute would not harm German suppliers. As part of the agreement, VW committed itself to enter into supply contracts to buy GM parts worth one billion dollars over a period of seven years. Schroeder said the parts supply deal had to be seen in the context of the total volume of the VW group. "Then you will quickly see that German suppliers will not be disadvantaged by this agreement," Schroeder said. The settlement also includes an "arrangement" under which VW will pay General Motors 100 million dollars. The two companies will drop all civil litigation against each other or against individuals, which includes a civil action brought against VW in the Detroit Federal Court in March 1996. The deal was greeted enthusiastically by financial markets and VW shares rose as much as two percent before paring gains on profit-taking. VW shares have risen about 10 percent this week on speculation that a deal would soon rid the carmaker of its legal troubles. GM sued VW in Detroit last year, alleging that Lopez and his followers stole secret data on GM's future European product plans, parts prices and manufacturing techniques that helped VW slash more than a billion marks in costs. GM also accused Piech and other top VW executives of conspiring with Lopez, a fiery 55-year-old Spaniard, to plot an elaborate scheme to transport documents to Germany and copy the data into VW's computers. VW had long denied the allegations but acknowledged in the settlement documents that there was a possibility of illegal activities by Lopez, who quit the VW management board in November.
83167>>0>> Jose Ignacio Lopez is a walking business school case-study whose reputation rests on far more than being the focus of a fierce battle between two of the world's car giants. Lopez, at the centre of a dispute between Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp. over allegations of industrial espionage, has been one of the most dynamic players in the global automobile industry. The two car giants settled their spat on Thursday, although Lopez, who has denied allegations that he stole documents from GM when he quit in 1993 to join VW, still faces criminal charges. The 55-year-old Spaniard, a slim balding figure, preaches the need to save Western civilisation through a new Industrial Revolution and efficiency in every area of life. For Lopez, efficiency goes beyond his merciless pressure on parts suppliers to cut prices or his success at both GM and VW in radically changing the way cars are produced. It goes as far as avoiding red meat and demanding loyalty from subordinates, whom he calls "co-warriors." He dictated diets for his lieutenants that were high in fiber and fruit and even told them to wear watches on the right wrist to remind them that their work was never done. In making his mark on the car industry, Lopez first helped turn around the European operations of GM in the 1980s, saving billions of dollars by squeezing parts suppliers to cut prices and convincing them that it was an honour to do business with GM. VW, Europe's largest carmaker, admired the ascent of the charismatic Lopez through the GM ranks. After he became the head of global purchasing at the world's largest carmaker in 1992, VW lured him away with a huge pay raise. He did his job well, transforming the lethargic VW, which had a 1 billion mark ($635 million at current rates) restructuring charge in 1993, into a lean operation able to build cars at competitive prices for world markets despite the strength of the German mark. The plan was simple -- transfer vehicle assembly and parts production to subcontractors, essentially converting an automaker to a brand name that keeps strict control over quality. Subcontractors not only supply the building blocks but also assemble some components themselves and even complete vehicles, creating an environment of high productivity and low costs. Lopez even gave the subcontractors help, sending his underlings out to show them how to maximize production. His theories were put into practice at VW's truck and bus plant in Brazil and a new factory in the Czech Republic where VW operates its Skoda unit -- both designed by Lopez. The problem is that GM says Lopez got the revolutionary ideas from the Detroit carmaker in tens of thousands of documents he is alleged to have taken along, including plans for a new super-efficient factory dubbed "Plant X." Lopez, whose VW salary reportedly more than tripled from his $375,000 base compensation at GM, and his underlings no longer work for VW and face German criminal charges for allegedly stealing the documents. But Lopez, who grew up in the Basque region of Spain and is currently living in his country of origin, is likely to keep working in the car industry as a consultant. He still has to fulfil his dream of building a car factory in his homeland region, where officials have set aside 1 million square meters (10.8 million square feet) of land for a plant.

83167>>0>> Ending one of the most bitter fights in corporate history, automakers Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp. Thursday reached an out-of-court settlement of alleged industrial espionage by executives who quit GM to join VW. In exchange for GM dropping its U.S. racketeering lawsuit against Volkswagen, the German automaker agreed to pay $100 million to GM and committed to purchasing $1 billion worth of GM auto parts over the next seven years. VW also acknowledged the possibility of illegal activities by Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and others who abruptly left GM to join VW in March 1993. GM sued VW in U.S. District Court in Detroit last year, alleging that Lopez and his followers stole secret documents on GM's future European product plans, parts prices and manufacturing techniques that helped VW slash its costs. GM also had accused VW Chairman Ferdiand Piech and other VW executives of conspiring with Lopez, a fiery 55-year-old Spaniard, to plot an elaborate scheme to transport the documents to Germany and copy the information into VW's computers. VW will sever all ties to Lopez until March 2000 as part of the deal, according to GM officials. When Lopez resigned as VW's production chief in November 1996, VW executives had said they would continue to use him as a paid consultant -- a decision that infuriated officials at GM and its Adam Opel AG unit in Germany. "That's been taken care of. Lopez will not be a consultant for VW until at least the year 2000," said the GM official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The settlement, hammered out this week in secret talks in Detroit, brought to an end a nearly four-year-old dispute and eliminated the risk of a multi-billion dollar jury verdict against VW in GM's hometown of Detroit. Both automakers, who are bitter rivals in Europe, said in a joint statement they looked forward to "a future unencumbered by the legacy of this matter." In a letter to GM that is part of the settlement, Piech confirmed that VW had accepted the resignations of Lopez, Jose Manuel Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez and Rosario Piazza, who face criminal charges filed by German prosecutors in December. VW said it "acknowledges the possibility that illegal activities by the individuals may have occurred. These allegations remain to be proven or disproven." The settlement does not affect the German criminal case, nor a similar criminal investigation in the United States. VW, in accepting that GM's actions were "not designed to harm Volkswagen's image," also retracted statements made by company officials that included allegations GM employees may have tampered with evidence later collected by prosecutors. GM Chairman Jack Smith and board member John Smale said in a letter to Piech and supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen that GM will abide by the decisions of prosecutors in the criminal investigations. Wall Street analysts said the deal will save both automakers millions of dollars and management time associated with litigation. One attorney involved in the U.S. lawsuit said the total cost of bringing the case to trial would have run into hundreds of millions of dollars. "It would have been a great case to try, but the companies are better off this way," he said. Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. auto analyst Kenneth Blaschke said GM probably could have won a bigger monetary settlement had it held out longer, but it wanted to put the dispute behind it to avoid damage to its reputation. He added that the parts contract, which will bring $143 million in new annual revenues to GM's Delphi Automotive Systems unit, will translate to increased annual profits of about $4.4 million, or one cent a share. A Delphi spokeswoman said the parts purchases have not all been determined. VW now purchases about $300 million in GM-produced parts per year, the majority of which are electrical wiring harnesses for cars. Lopez, who slashed purchasing costs at GM-Europe in the late 1980s, wasted no time in shaking up Detroit's automotive suppliers when Smith named him GM's director of worldwide purchasing in 1992. But VW, eager slash its own bloated costs, pursued him doggedly, offering a position on the management board. GM's Smith begged him to stay and offered him the presidency of the company's core North American operations. Smith planned to announce the promotion at a news conference in March 1993, but glumly told reporters that he received word at the last minute that Lopez had bolted to VW and was on a plane to Germany. "Jack Smith was publicly humiliated and made a fool of four years ago by Lopez. I think he wanted a public apology for that," said Burnham Securities auto analyst David Healy. Throughout the dispute, GM had repeatedly called on VW to fire Lopez and his associates as well as to issue a public apology and admit wrongdoing as part of any settlement deal. VW shares rose in Frankfurt to a record 706.90 marks ($448.50) on speculation that a settlement was imminent. GM shares closed unchanged Thursday at $59.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.
83167>>0>> Adam Opel AG, declaring victory in its row over charges of industrial spying with Volkswagen AG, said on Friday it never wanted to win damages of a size that would have crippled the German carmaker. Opel, the German unit of General Motors Corp, said the deal reached on Thursday over charges that cost-cutting production guru Jose Ignacio Lopez stole GM data when he joined VW in 1993, freed VW from the risk of a U.S. jury ruling in the billions of dollars. The deal was greeted enthusiastically by the markets and  VW shares rose as much as two percent before paring gains on profit-taking. VW shares have risen about 10 percent this week on speculation that a deal would soon rid the carmaker of its legal troubles. VW shares reached a new record high at 724.50 marks before ending bourse trade up 21.50 marks at 712 marks. In post-bourse IBIS electronic trade, they slipped to 695 marks. VW agreed to pay GM $100 million, buy $1 billion worth of GM parts over the next seven years and retract statements that included charges GM may have tampered with evidence before it was collected by German prosecutors. In return, GM agreed to drop its U.S. lawsuit in a Detroit federal court based on racketeering laws that call for any damages awarded by a jury to be automatically tripled. "Our objectives were never to receive damages which could fully compensate for what was done because it would have been a catastrophe for VW and would have then undercut our role in the world," Opel chief executive David Herman told a news briefing. "We would have never done it. We never wanted to do it. Our actions with the U.S. lawsuit were aimed at getting VW to negotiate," he said at Opel's headquarters near Frankfurt. Volkswagen also said on Friday it did not expect a serious impact on its profit due to the settlement, with analysts noting the carmaker has more than 17 billion marks ($10.8 billion) in reserves. "The compromise is a little cloud in an otherwise bright sky," VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said on Friday. The two carmakers on Thursday ended the fight after several days of intensive talks between their lawyers in Washington D.C. Herman said VW initiated the new round in early January after German prosecutors filed charges against Lopez, who also faces a probe by U.S. prosecutors in Detroit. Three previous rounds of talks during the last four years had failed. "After the indictment against Lopez, the situation became more or less clear. The moment was right," said Herman, noting that GM had spent about 10 million marks on legal fees. GM sued VW in Detroit last year, alleging that Lopez and his followers stole secret data on GM's future European product plans, parts prices and manufacturing techniques that helped VW slash more than a billion marks in costs. GM also had accused VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech and other top VW executives of conspiring with Lopez, a fiery 55-year-old Spaniard, to plot an elaborate scheme to transport documents to Germany and copy the data into VW's computers. VW had long denied the allegations but acknowledged in the settlement documents that there was a possibility of illegal activities by Lopez, who quit the VW management board in November, and others who left GM to join VW in March 1993. The German carmaker VW also confirmed it had accepted the resignations of Spaniards Jose Manuel Gutierrez and Jorge Alvarez and Italian Rosario Piazza as part of the deal. Herman dismissed comments by industry analysts that the deal favoured Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, and that GM, the top rival of VW in Europe, let the carmaker off easy. He said the $100 million payment, to be paid within 60 days, was "a massive amount of money, particularly for Germany". GM officials also declined to say how they reached the $1 billion figure for VW parts purchases -- in addition to VW's current annual purchases from the U.S. group of some $300 million of parts. But Herman said the GM parts would be sold at a profit but at competitive market prices. "We got what we wanted, so we are happy. Could we have gotten something else or done something more, perhaps, but that did not seem as important," Herman said. ($1=1.5772 Mark)
83167>>0>> Investors intensified their love affair with Volkswagen AG Friday only hours after the German carmaker and General Motors Corp. settled their bitter dispute over allegations of industrial spying. VW shares rose as much as two percent, reaching a record high at 724.50 marks, and kept up their advance that has so far netted VW investors about 10 percent since Tuesday when speculation about a potential deal began to emerge. Industry analysts said VW shares should keep up the advance in the near-term, propelled by the settlement late on Thursday of the row over allegations that former VW management board member Jose Ignacio Lopez stole secret documents when he left GM in 1993. An additional factor is Volkswagen's outlook for growth, they said. VW has sorted out problems at subsidiaries in Spain and the Czech Republic and is seeking to expand in emerging markets such as South America and Asia, particularly in China, while increasing production volumes in Europe. "This removes a major risk for VW," said one Frankfurt industry analyst. "I would only expect positive news from VW in the coming years. When you look at the fundamentals, their market share in western Europe is expected to rise at least through 1998 due to new products coming out in the new years," the analyst said. The settlement calls for VW to pay GM $100 million, buy $1 billion worth of GM car parts over a seven-year period and retract statements made about the U.S. carmaker. VW now buys about $300 million in GM parts each year, the majority of which are electrical wiring harnesses for cars. In return, GM has agreed to drop all civil litigation against VW, including its racketeering lawsuit filed in a Detroit federal court, which had threatened VW with a potential jury damages verdict in the billions of dollars. "It's an incredibily clever deal but also sensible for both partners to end this fight," said Peter Schmidt at Automotive Industry Data in Britain. "This fight seemed from the beginning like two children fighting over sweets." Schmidt said the settlement will allow both carmakers to focus on their businesses at a time of difficult industry conditions in Europe, where overcapacity and economic worries are dampening car sales, as well as to expand in new markets. "When you look at the problems both carmakers face in Europe, it seems so odd that so much valuable executive time was devoted to this haggling and fighting over something that was not really worth fighting for," Schmidt said. Wall Street analysts said the deal will save both carmakers millions of dollars and management time associated with litigation as well as save face for both carmakers who risked damaging their brand images in a nasty court battle. But one industry analyst said those seeking quick gains on VW may be too late now that the shares have recovered their poise, noting the market got overly excited about the threat of VW facing a multi-billion dollar payout. "I still rate them as a buy but I am now advising that VW shares are moving toward fair value," Barber said. "The fear was overdone," he said. "The settlement is a fairly small figure when you look at the extent of the provision on the VW balance sheet. It should have no effect on VW at all."
83167>>0>> Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the man at the centre of a long and bitter battle between two of the world's car making giants, is accused of industrial espionage and is one of the world's toughest cost-cutters. Lopez ruthlessly redefined supply relations at U.S. car giant General Motors and went on to use his revolutionary principles to put Germany's Volkswagen AG back into profit. His talents earned him the nickname of "Superlopez" but his reputation was tainted by allegations that he took industrial secrets on purchasing and car-production when he defected to VW from General Motors in early 1993. But many in his home town of Amorebieta in Spain see him in a more positive light and still hope he will help set up a car factory there. Lopez has denied the allegations but was forced to resign from his job late last year as a result of the fight and on Thursday the two companies came to terms. The settlement calls for VW to pay GM $100 million, buy some $1 billion worth of GM car parts over a seven-year period and retract statements made about the U.S. car maker. In return, GM has agreed to drop all civil litigation against VW, including its racketeering lawsuit filed in a Detroit federal court, which had threatened VW with a potential jury damages verdict in the billions of dollars. VW said late on Thursday that it "acknowledges the possibility that illegal activities by the individuals may have occurred. These allegations remain to be proven or disproven." The trouble has not dimmed the strong feelings of support the 16,000 people of Amorebieta hold for Lopez however, who himself has always denied the charges. "Our village follows the news about the accusations against Jose Ignacio with a lot of interest but we are confident that it will be resolved," said boyhood friend Jaime Fernandez Amar in the town of Amorebieta, 400 km (248.5 miles) north of Madrid. Lopez, married to a Basque woman for 27 years, continues to visit the town and his mother, who lives in a modest flat. Many count on Lopez's love of his homeland and his know-how to help revive his town's industrial aspirations and save it from becoming a bedroom community for nearby Bilbao. They hope he will help set up a car factory here. "This is a man of his town, a hard worker who has always achieved what he wanted," said a local journalist. But Volkswagen discarded initial plans to build a factory in Amorebieta in 1993. A second project, to open a truck plant, also failed to materialise when VW opted for Brazil. However, the provincial government of Vizcaya says talks with the German automaker have been reopened and it has reserved one million square metres of land should they end well. "Knowing him, I can vouch that he has never done anything against his conscience," said the journalist. "Everything they said he robbed he did not need to take because he had it in his head. They were his own ideas."
83167>>0>> Adam Opel AG, the German unit of General Motors Corp, said on Friday that its settlement of a bitter dispute with rival Volkswagen AG over allegations of industrial spying fulfilled all of its goals. Opel management board chairman David Herman told a news conference that the deal, which was announced late on Thursday, for the first time required VW to admit a possibility of illegal activity when Jose Ignacio Lopez transferred from GM to VW in March 1993. "From the beginning of this dispute Opel and GM have stood by their demands for the fulfilment of basic requirements to reach such a deal. We are satisfied that these requirements have been fulfilled," Herman said. In addition Herman noted in the first statement from Opel on the issue that VW has cut all ties with Lopez and the associates who followed him to GM - a demand made by Opel. The deal also called for VW to retract statements it had made about Opel and GM and also pay for damages. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Adam Opel AG, the German unit of U.S. carmaker General Motors AG, said that legal costs in the long-running legal dispute with Volkswagen amounted to 10 million marks ($6.3 million). "The legal costs for GM-Opel are around ten million deutschemarks," said Adam Opel management board chairman David Herman at a news conference. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525 ($ = 1.577 German Marks)

The long-running legal dispute between the two companies was resolved on Thursday night. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG said on Friday it did not expect a serious impact on its profit from its out-of-court settlement of with General Motors, "The compromise is a little cloud in an otherwise bright sky," VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said.   VW was restructured and its sales were excellent, Kock said, adding that the carmaker had set aside reserves to cover legal costs. "Things are covered, I do not want to go into individual figures," said Kocks, who is also management board member of VW. VW and GM ended one of the bitterest battles in corporate history on Thursday by reaching an out-of-court deal over alleged industrial espionage by GM executives who moved to VW. VW, Europe's largest carmaker, said it had agreed to pay $100 million to GM, whose German unit Adam Opel AG is VW's biggest rival in Europe, and acknowledged there might have been wrongdoing by the individuals who quit GM to join VW in 1993. Both sides agreed to drop all legal actions against each other and VW committed itself to buy GM parts worth $1 billion over a seven-year period. Kocks declined to comment on claims by GM managers in Detroit that the deal stipulated that Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, VW's former production chief at the centre of the allegations, must not work for VW again before the year 2000. "I can't answer that," Kocks said. Lopez resigned from VW at the end of November to work as an independent consultant. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

83167>>0>> Following are transcripts of letters sent between General Motors Corp and Volkswagen AG to end their nearly four-year-old legal dispute over allegations of industrial spying. The two carmakers announced terms of the out-of-court settlement on Thursday. Both letters are dated January 9, 1997. The settlement calls for VW to pay GM $100 million, buy some $1 billion worth of car parts over a seven-year period and retract statements made about the U.S. carmaker. In return, GM has agreed to drop all civil litigation against VW, including its racketeering lawsuit filed in a Detroit federal court, which had threatened VW with a potential jury verdict payout in the billions of dollars. VOLKSWAGEN LETTER TO GM: Mr. John G. Smale Member, Board of Directors General Motors Corporation Mr. John F. Smith Jr. Chairman of the Board General Motors Corporation Gentlemen: This letter is part of our agreement to settle the civil disputes between Volkswagen AG on one side and General Motors Corporation and Adam Opel AG on the other side. We confirm that Volkswagen has accepted the resignation of Messrs. Lopez and Gutierrez as of November 29, 1996. Messrs. Alvarez and Piazza will resign or take administrative leave no later than by the end of January 1997. The indictment of Messrs. Lopez, Gutierrez, Alvarez and Piazza brought by the Darmstadt prosecutor in December 1996 alleges illegal activities which are presently in front of a German court. Therefore, Volkswagen acknowledges the possibility that illegal activities by the individuals may have occurred. These allegations remain to be proven or disproven. Volkswagen understands GM/Opel's concerns with respect to possible wrongdoing by the indicted individuals. Volkswagen also respects, however, the constitutional right of these individuals to be considered innocent until proven guilty. You have informed us that GM/Opel's commencement of legal actions or public statements were not designed to harm Volkswagen's image or to defame Volkswagen or its executives. We accept this clarification and rescind any statements we have made to the contrary. Volkswagen regrets any statements that have been interpreted to suggest that GM/Opel had planted or fabricated evidence. We do not believe that GM/Opel's actions constituted an attack on Germany as an industrial location. Volkswagen is pleased that this letter and the actions taken allow us to bring the civil disputes to an end. We regret, as we understand GM does, that there has been such a public escalation of our disputes. The agreement reached between GM/Opel and Volkswagen creates future business opportunities for both sides, while remaining competitors in the automotive industry. Signed Dr Klaus Liesen Dr Ferdinand Piech GM LETTER TO VOLKSWAGEN Dr Klaus Liesen Chairman, Board of Supervisors Volkswagen AG Dr Ferdinand Piech Chairman, Board of Management Volkswagen AG Gentlemen: This letter responds to the letter you have sent us as part of our agreement to settle and resolve the civil disputes which our management has had with Volkswagen's management over the Lopez affair. It is regrettable, as you indicate, that this dispute between our companies escalated to such a great degree. Circumstances required that we avail ourselves of the United States civil law causes of action. We have directed our counsel to dismiss the charges made against Dr Piech and Dr Neumann and, pursuant to the terms of our agreement, to dismiss our complaint against the rest of the defendants as well. Our civil complaint against Volkswagen and some of your executives did not constitute criminal charges. We will continue to cooperate fully with the public prosecutors as requested by them. General Motors and Opel necessarily will abide by and respect the judgements of the prosecutors and the outcome of their investigations and proceedings. We are pleased that Volkswagen has acknowledged the legitimacy of our concerns and that our companies have found a satisfactory basis for the resolution of our outstanding civil disputes. We look forward to a future unencumbered by the legacy of this matter. Sincerely, John G. Smale John F Smith --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> General Motors Corp (GM) said it would assume its own legal costs stemming from the lengthy legal dispute with German car group Volkswagen AG, sources at the U.S. automotive manufacturer said.   On Thursday Germany's Handelsblatt financial newspaper said that under the settlement reached between GM and VW, VW would pay GM's legal costs from the nearly four-year legal battle. However, the GM source denied this. "The agreement does not include VW assuming our legal fees," the source at GM told Reuters in response to inquiries. "Each of the two parties pay their own costs," he added. Late on Thursday the two automakers reached an out-of-court settlement. In exchange for GM dropping its U.S. racketeering lawsuit against VW, the German automaker agreed to pay $100 million to GM and committed to purchasing $1 billion worth of GM auto parts over the next seven years. -- Zurich Editorial +41 1 631 7340
83167>>0>> HSBC James Capel automotive industry analyst Bob Barber said on Friday he still rated shares in Volkswagen AG as a buy but believed the German carmaker's shares were moving toward fair value. "I still rate them as a buy but I am now advising that VW shares are moving toward fair value," Barber told Reuters. "VW was once rated one of the cheapest stocks in the sector," he said. But he added, "The extent to which we have been pushing this stock has been moderating. It is not a sell but the sharp rise over the last two months makes it only moderately undervalued." VW shares rose on Friday after the two carmakers said late on Thursday that they have settled their lawsuit over allegations that some former GM executives stole secret documents when they quit in March 1993 to join VW. At 0910 GMT, VW was up 10.30 marks at 718.20 but off the session high at 724.50 marks, a new record high, in pre-bourse IBIS electronic dealings. The settlement calls for VW to pay GM $100 million, buy some $1 billion worth of car parts over a seven-year period and retract statements made about the U.S. carmaker. In return, GM has agreed to drop all civil litigation against VW, including its racketeering lawsuit filed in a Detroit federal court, which had threatened VW with a potential jury verdict payout in the billions of dollars. Barber noted that VW shares "had been racing up" in anticipation of a potential settlement and realisation among investors that the chances were limited for VW to face a multi-billion dollar payout in a jury trial. "The fear were overdone," Barber said. "The settlement is a fairly small figure when you look at the extent of the provision on its balance sheet. It should have no effect on VW at all." Barber said VW has sorted out its problems in Spain with its SEAT unit and in the Czech Republic with its Skoda operations while also being poised for expansion in emerging markets such as South America and Asia. "People got a bit too wound up when they started talking about billions of dollars in jury rulings. It seemed unlikely. We can now look at the company clean again," Barber said. The company has sorted out its problems in Spain and the Czech Republic and is seeking to expand in emerging markets such as South America and Asia. "I think looking back will see this as being a side issue to the improvement that has been taking place in VW's performance and its international operations," Barber said. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

The news conference was called to discuss GM's settlement with VW of a long-standing dispute over allegations some GM executives left the carmaker for VW in 1993 with secret documents. The two companies announced an out-of-court settlement late on Thursday that calls for VW to pay GM $100 million and buy some $1 billion worth of parts over seven years while also severing ties with the executives who left GM for VW. Opel said GM vice president Hans Wilhelm Gaeb, Opel management board chairman David Herman and Opel management board member Horst Borghs would attend the news conference. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Bank Julius Baer said on Friday it has raised its recommendation on Volkswagen AG to buy from neutral after the German carmaker on Thursday settled its industrial spying allegations with General Motors Corp. Bank Julius Baer analyst Falk Frey also said he lowered VW to "average risk" from "high risk" and has set a price target for the shares at 840 marks. VW shares were up 10.10 marks at 718 marks in pre-bourse IBIS dealings, but off the session high so far at 724.50 marks, after announcing the deal with GM late on Thursday. Frey said he has not changed his earnings expectations for VW and was waiting for the Wolfsburg-based carmaker to release 1996 results in the coming weeks before taking action. "This removes a major risk for VW," Frey said of the deal. "I would only expect positive news from VW in the coming years. When you look at the fundamentals, their market share in western Europe is expected to rise through 1998 due to new products coming out in the new years," he said. Among the new products to be offered by VW, Frey said the carmaker was counting on the new version of its popular Golf and a sub-mini vehicle to be launched in 1997 under the VW and SEAT brand names. VW is also planning to launch a new version of the Beetle in North and South America, which will generate additional sales, Frey said. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Shares in Volkswagen AG surged on Friday after the German carmaker said on Thursday that it had reached an out-of-court settlement with General Motors Corp over allegations of industrial spying. VW shares rose as high as 724.50 marks to a new record high but then pared gains to trade up 13.20 marks at 721.10 marks in pre-bourse IBIS electronic dealings.

83167>>0>> What's good for General Motors Corp is now also certainly good for Germany. The end of the four-year-old legal dispute between GM and Volkswagen AG on Thursday over allegations of industrial spying will go down as a victory for the U.S. giant, which got the German carmaker to meet all its demands for a deal. VW agreed to pay GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG, $100 million and buy $1 billion worth of car parts over seven years, ridding itself of the headache over the March 1993 transfer of Jose Ignacio Lopez to VW and allegations he stole GM documents.   The carmaker was also vindicated when VW retracted previous statements that GM sought to damage the reputation of Germany as an economic centre and fired the rest of the associates who followed Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, to VW in March 1993. VW was under intense pressure to settle the dispute. A poll in December showed 43 percent of Germans were convinced VW's image had suffered as a result of the GM accusations. The survey of 1,000 Germans in early December also showed that 35 percent feared VW sales would fall and a third expected VW, one of Germany's largest employeers with about 100,000 workers in the country, to lose jobs as a result.   Opel officials had also long believed an out-of-court settlement of their Detroit lawsuit -- which charged top VW executives with racketeering laws first used to fight organized crime -- as a way to win without damaging the GM reputation. Still, the deal will also allow VW to resume focusing on its business of making cars and a profit -- especially in GM's backyard in the United States. While secret talks began earlier this week in Detroit to end the dispute, VW was saying publicly that it expected its sales in the United States to rise about 25 percent in 1997 after surging 18 percent to 135,907 vehicles in 1996.   VW's U.S. sales in comparison to GM, which is the world's largest automaker, but VW is making inroads in the American market while maintaining its European market share at a time of production overcapacity and tough price competition. West European car registration data for December shows VW with a 17.9 percent market share for the month and GM, which also includes its Vauxhall brand, second at 12.2 percent. GM has sunk far since its 1960s glory days when it commanded half of the U.S. market. As recently as the 1980s, it held as much as 45 percent of the U.S. passenger car market.   In 1996, GM's U.S. light vehicle sales fell 2.7 percent to 4.74 million units, causing its market share to drop to 31 percent from 32.6 percent in 1995 and 33.1 percent in 1994. VW, meanwhile, has painted a bright outlook, saying worldwide deliveries in 1996 rose by some 400,000 to almost four million vehicles and that profits would top 1995 levels. It's a far cry from the situation when VW posted a billion mark loss in 1993 tied to restructuring costs, and Lopez was called on to make VW's costly production and purchasing operations competitive again. Critics will certainly argue that GM should get the credit for the turnaround since German prosecutors say Lopez used GM data in presentations to VW managers. But the impact of Lopez's work has long been felt at GM, which has complained that its 20 percent cost advantage in Europe over VW has been blunted. And VW is not yet in the clear since German prosecutors have filed criminal charges against Lopez and three others. A trial is expected as soon as later this year. A U.S. grand jury is also investigating Lopez, which could lead to fresh revelations about VW's role in the saga despite German prosecutors saying they found no sufficient evidence of a conspiracy between Lopez and top VW executives. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

VW has sorted out problems at subsidiaries in Spain and the Czech Republic and is seeking to expand in emerging markets such as South America and Asia, particularly in China, while increasing production volumes in Europe. "This removes a major risk for VW," said one Frankfurt industry analyst. "I would only expect positive news from VW in the coming years. When you look at the fundamentals, their market share in western Europe is expected to rise at least through 1998 due to new products coming out in the new years," the analyst said. The settlement calls for VW to pay GM $100 million, buy some $1 billion worth of GM car parts over a seven-year period and retract statements made about the U.S. carmaker. VW now buys about $300 million in GM parts each year, the majority of which are electrical wiring harnesses for cars. In return, GM has agreed to drop all civil litigation against VW, including its racketeering lawsuit filed in a Detroit federal court, which had threatened VW with a potential jury damages verdict in the billions of dollars. "It's an incredibily clever deal but also sensible for both partners to end this fight," said Peter Schmidt at Automotive Industry Data in Britain. "This fight seemed from the beginning like two children fighting over sweets." Schmidt said the settlement will allow both carmakers to focus on their businesses at a time of difficult industry conditions in Europe, where overcapacity and economic worries are dampening car sales, as well as to expand in new markets. "When you look at the problems both carmakers face in Europe, it seems so odd that so much valuable executive time was devoted to this haggling and fighting over something that was not really worth fighting for," Schmidt said. Wall Street analysts said the deal will save both carmakers millions of dollars and management time associated with litigation as well as save face for both carmakers who risked damaging their brand images in a nasty court battle. One attorney involved in the U.S. lawsuit said the cost of bringing the case to trial would have run into hundreds of millions of dollars. "It would have been a great case to try, but the companies are better off this way," he said.
83167>>0>> Ending one of the most bitter fights in corporate history, automakers Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp. Thursday reached an out-of-court settlement of alleged industrial espionage by executives who quit GM to join VW. In exchange for GM dropping its U.S. racketeering lawsuit against Volkswagen, the German automaker agreed to pay $100 million to GM and committed to purchasing $1 billion worth of GM auto parts over the next seven years. VW also acknowledged the possibility of illegal activities by Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and others who abruptly left GM to join VW in March 1993. GM sued VW in U.S. District Court in Detroit last year, alleging that Lopez and his followers stole secret documents on GM's future European product plans, parts prices and manufacturing techniques that helped VW slash its costs. GM also had accused VW Chairman Ferdiand Piech and other VW executives of conspiring with Lopez, a fiery 55-year-old Spaniard, to plot an elaborate scheme to transport the documents to Germany and copy the information into VW's computers. VW will sever all ties to Lopez until March 2000 as part of the deal, according to GM officials. When Lopez resigned as VW's production chief in November 1996, VW executives had said they would continue to use him as a paid consultant -- a decision that infuriated officials at GM and its Adam Opel AG unit in Germany. "That's been taken care of. Lopez will not be a consultant for VW until at least the year 2000," said the GM official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The settlement, hammered out this week in secret talks in Detroit, brought to an end a nearly four-year-old dispute and eliminated the risk of a multi-billion dollar jury verdict against VW in GM's hometown of Detroit. Both automakers, who are bitter rivals in Europe, said in a joint statement they looked forward to "a future unencumbered by the legacy of this matter." In a letter to GM that is part of the settlement, Piech confirmed that VW had accepted the resignations of Lopez, Jose Manuel Gutierrez, Jorge Alvarez and Rosario Piazza, who face criminal charges filed by German prosecutors in December. VW said it "acknowledges the possibility that illegal activities by the individuals may have occurred. These allegations remain to be proven or disproven." The settlement does not affect the German criminal case, nor a similar criminal investigation in the United States. VW, in accepting that GM's actions were "not designed to harm Volkswagen's image," also retracted statements made by company officials that included allegations GM employees may have tampered with evidence later collected by prosecutors. GM Chairman Jack Smith and board member John Smale said in a letter to Piech and supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen that GM will abide by the decisions of prosecutors in the criminal investigations. Wall Street analysts said the deal will save both automakers millions of dollars and management time associated with litigation. One attorney involved in the U.S. lawsuit said the cost of bringing the case to trial would have run into  hundreds of millions of dollars. "It would have been a great case to try, but the companies are better off this way," he said. Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. auto analyst Kenneth Blaschke said GM probably could have won a bigger monetary settlement had it held out longer, but it wanted to put the dispute behind it to avoid damage to its reputation. He added that the parts contract, which will bring $143 million in new annual revenues to GM's Delphi Automotive Systems unit, will translate to increased annual profits of about $4.4 million, or one cent a share. VW now purchases about $300 million in GM-produced parts per year, the majority of which are electrical wiring harnesses for cars. Lopez, who slashed purchasing costs at GM-Europe in the late 1980s, wasted no time in shaking up Detroit's automotive suppliers when Smith named him GM's director of worldwide purchasing in 1992. But VW, eager slash its own bloated costs, pursued him doggedly, offering a position on the management board. VW shares rose in Frankfurt to a record 706.90 marks ($448.50) on speculation that a settlement was imminent. GM shares closed unchanged Thursday at $59.125 on the New York Stock Exchange.

GM's Smith begged him to stay and offered him the presidency of the company's core North American operations. Smith planned to announce the promotion at a news conference in March 1993, but glumly told reporters that he received word at the last minute that Lopez had bolted to VW and was on a plane to Germany. "Jack Smith was publicly humiliated and made a fool of four years ago by Lopez. I think he wanted a public apology for that," said Burnham Securities auto analyst David Healy. Throughout the dispute, GM had repeatedly called on VW to fire Lopez and his associates as well as to issue a public apology and admit wrongdoing as part of any settlement deal.

83167>>0>> What's good for General Motors is now also certainly good for Germany. The end on Thursday of the four-year-old legal dispute between General Motors Corp and Volkswagen AG over allegations of industrial spying will go down as a victory for the U.S. giant, which got the German carmaker to meet all its demands for a deal. VW agreed to pay GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG, $100 million and buy $1 billion worth of car parts over seven years, ridding itself of the headache over the March 1993 transfer of Jose Ignacio Lopez to VW and allegations he stole GM documents. GM was also vindicated when VW retracted previous statements that GM sought to damage the reputation of Germany as an economic centre and fired the rest of the associates who followed Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, to VW in March 1993. VW was under intense pressure to settle the dispute. An opinion poll in December showed 43 percent of Germans were convinced VW's image had suffered as a result of the GM accusations. The survey of 1,000 Germans in early December also showed that 35 percent feared VW sales would fall and one-third expected VW, with about 100,000 workers in Germany, to lose jobs as a result. Opel officials had long believed an out-of-court settlement to their Detroit lawsuit, which charged top VW executives with racketeering laws first used to fight the Mafia, was a way to win without damaging the GM reputation. But the deal will also allow VW to resume focusing on its business of making cars and a profit -- especially in the backyard of GM in the United States. While secret talks began earlier this week in Detroit to end the dispute, VW was saying publicly that it expected its sales in the United States to rise about 25 percent in 1997 after surging 18 percent to 135,907 vehicles in 1996. VW's sales in the United States pale in comparison to GM, which is the world's largest automaker. But VW is making inroads in the American market while maintaining its European market share at a time of production overcapacity and tough price competition. West European car registration data for December show VW with a 17.9 percent market share for the month and GM, which also includes its Vauxhall brand, second at 12.2 percent. GM has sunk far since its glory days in the 1960s when it commanded half of the U.S. market. As recently as the 1980s, it held as much as 45 percent of the U.S. passenger car market. In 1996, GM's U.S. light vehicle sales fell 2.7 percent to 4.74 million units, causing its market share to drop to 31 percent from 32.6 percent in 1995 and 33.1 percent in 1994. VW, meanwhile, has painted a bright outlook, saying worlwide deliveries in 1996 rose by some 400,000 to almost four million vehicles and that profits would top 1995 levels. It is a far cry from the situation when VW posted a billion mark ($635 million) loss in 1993 tied to restructuring costs and new VW management board Ferdinand Piech called on Lopez to make competitive VW's costly production and purchasing operations. Critics will certainly argue that GM should get the credit for the turnaround since German prosecutors say Lopez used GM data in presentations to VW managers. But the impact of Lopez's work has long been felt at GM, which has complained that its 20 percent cost advantage in Europe over VW has been blunted. And VW is not yet in the clear since German prosecutors have filed criminal charges against Lopez and three others. A trial is expected as soon as later this year. A U.S. grand jury is also investigating Lopez. That could lead to fresh revelations about VW's role in the saga despite German prosecutors saying they had not found sufficient evidence of a conspiracy between Lopez and top VW executives. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525 ($1=1.5711 Mark)
83167>>0>> Lobbyists for German shareholders' rights this weekend criticised the out-of-court deal reached by car giants Volkswagen AG and General Motors Corp over allegations of industrial espionage. While lobbyists welcomed the end to the companies' lengthy feud, they said the deal had made it impossible for minority shareholders to identify who was to blame, and could end up costing shareholders a considerable amount. "The question arises -- who is actually supposed to pay this $100 million?," Reinhild Kreitel, spokeswoman for the German small shareholders' asociation, told Reuters. VW averted a potentially costly U.S. jury ruling on Thursday when it settled with GM over charges that cost-cutting production guru Jose Ignacio Lopez stole GM data when he joined VW in 1993. VW agreed to pay GM $100 million in compensation, buy $1 billion worth of GM parts over the next seven years and retract statements such as charges that GM may have tampered with evidence before it was released to German prosecutors. In return, GM agreed to drop its U.S. lawsuit in a Detroit federal court based on racketeering laws that call for any damages awarded by a jury to be automatically tripled. While VW said the deal would not have a serious impact on its profits, Keitel said the shareholder lobby group was considering withholding approval for the VW management and supervisory boards at the next shareholder meeting. The rise of some 12 percent in VW's share price this week -- the stock closed Friday up three percent at 712 marks -- would not be enough to compensate shareholders for potential losses arising from the incident, Keitel said. "The shares had been burdened by the court case for a long time. Now they are merely making up those losses," she said. Ekkehard Wenger, founder of the German association for promotion of shareholder democracy, also said it would be unacceptable to expect small shareholders to pay for management errors. "The management board will have to come up with some explanations at the annual general meeting," he said in a telephone interview. -- Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> The international community issued a stern warning to Bosnians on Sunday -- build a joint government and carry out economic reforms or there will be no fund-raising conference for the country's reconstruction. An international donors' conference scheduled for March aimed at raising $1.4 billion for Bosnia is at risk unless peacetime leaders adopt laws on a single central bank, a single currency, a 1997 budget and servicing of the country's external debt, Western envoys said. "For the donors' conference to be successful, there must be clear proof of you moving forward on your own," Carl Bildt, the international High Representative to Bosnia, told an economic reform conference in Sarajevo sponsored by his office. Various foreign experts outlined the necessity of a so-called "immediate action agenda", by which Bosnia must adopt laws that would provide a long-term framework for creating a self- sustainable economy. Adopting these laws is a precondition for an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which the donors will be expecting before committing $1.4 billion, officials said. "Unless there is co-operation undertaking the immediate action agenda, unless there is an agreement with the IMF -- the donors' conference will not go forward as scheduled," said David Lipton, assistant secretary at the U.S. Treasury. "There must be strong enough prospects that donors' contributions will bring sustained economic recovery, not just temporary relief," he said. Bosnia's newly appointed central government ministers listened carefully to the experts' warnings but even their separate seating plan showed that economic reforms have a way to go before political differences are overcome. "Political problems are the key. There is non-stop improvisation on who needs to decide what and when we can't agree, it all goes to (three-man) Presidency," Hasan Muratovic, minister for foreign trade and economy, told Reuters. "Politics is continuing to intervene and stall something that is a technical issue. We need to be able to reach quick decisions without mulling at a higher level," he said. The slow process of setting up Bosnia's joint institutions after its general elections in September has underlined the need to boost economic relations between the Moslem-Croat federation and the Serb entity, foreign experts said. "Without a single central bank, single currency, a united payment system and united market, the Bosnian market will devolve into several small segmented markets, none of which will flourish," Lipton said. IMF chief of mission in Bosnia, Scott Brown, said he would like to use the rest of January to complete negotiations with the new Bosnian government on adopting laws on a central bank and other key economic issues. "We would very much hope that difficult but conceptually very simple decisions that are needed to finalise this issue can be taken in a matter of days," he said. Bildt told the conference the country faced a pivotal moment which could lead to Bosnia becoming a "shining star in this part of Europe". "But you can also fail, and if you fail, your failure wil be massive."

83167>>0>> General Motors Chairman Jack Smith acknowledged on Sunday that protecting the automaker's reputation and sales in Germany was one of the factors that caused it to settle its bitter industrial espionage dispute with Volkswagen AG. Smith, speaking to reporters for the first time since the deal was struck on Thursday, also said GM would profit handsomely from the $100 million payment VW agreed to make as part of the settlement. According to preliminary estimates made by GM's lawyers, he said the automaker's legal fees associated with the dispute totaled about $7.5 million. He said GM would expect to receive the cash within 60 to 90 days. The landmark settlement calls for GM to drop its U.S. racketeering suit against VW, which accused former VW purchasing chief Jose Ignacio Lopez and others of stealing industrial secrets when they quit GM to join VW in 1993. In addition to the $100 million payment VW agreed to purchase $1 billion worth of GM parts over the next seven years and retract statements such as charges that GM may have tampered with evidence before it was released to German prosecutors. The deal, which ended one of the bitterest feuds in corporate history, eliminated the risk of a multibillion dollar jury verdict against VW in GM's hometown of Detroit. "We did have a strong case, but we were anxious to close out the case," Smith said. "We're happy we got it behind us." Asked if GM was worried that negative publicity surrounding the four-year-old dispute would damage the the reputation of its Adam Opel AG unit among German consumers, Smith said, "All those factors are out there, you know, and its a combination of issues that you make your judgement of what to do." "Clearly Volkswagen wanted to get it settled and they thought it was an opportune time to put it to bed," Smith said.

83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG spokesman Klaus Kocks said on Tuesday that General Motors Corp would deliver VW standard parts as part of an out-of-court legal settlement reached last week. Kocks also said that VW would pay compensation if a parts buying scheme under the deal came to less than the agreed one billion dollars. VW agreed last week to an out-of-court settlement with GM on charges of industrial espionage made by the American car maker. Under the deal, VW must pay 100 million dollars compensation to GM and buy one billion dollars worth of parts.   VW says GM will deliver VW standard parts VW must make the parts purchases between January 9 and December 30 2003. Kocks said that in the event VW did not buy all the one billion dollars worth of parts agreed to, his company would pay 10 percent of the difference between what it did buy and what it was supposed to. --Frankfurt Newsroom + 49 69 75625
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG has not renewed the contract of VW management board member Martin Posth, who leads the German carmaker's operations in Asia, Germany's Manager Magazine said on Tuesday. Posth, who joined the VW management board in 1988, has been informed of the decision by VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen, the magazine said. A VW spokesman declined comment but noted that the next supervisory board meeting was not scheduled until mid-March. The magazine said Posth's five-year contract had not been extended, allowing VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech to oust the last of the board members who were held over from former VW management board chairman Carl Hahn. Speculation about Posth's future with VW has been strong in recent months due to criticism by Piech of the carmaker's operations in Asia and his desire to bring his own top managers onto the VW board. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Security forces in northwestern Iran have arrested six people on charges of spying for unnamed foreign countries, the official Iranian news agency IRNA said on Wednesday. It quoted the leading internal security official in West Azerbaijan province as saying the six had confessed to spying by providing "foreign elements...with films and pictures of strategic and military areas (and) assisting these elements in their sabotage operations". Those arrested had also provided "political, economic and cultural information", said the official, who did not name the foreign countries alleged to be involved. Iran last year said it had broken up several spy rings in the area, some of which it said were led by Turkish diplomats. Turkey denied the charges. Tehran earlier this month executed two men for spying for Israel and the United States and committing economic sabotage. Iran last year started enforcing a new Islamic penal code which imposes the death sentence for anyone providing confidential information to foreigners, especially the United States and Israel, or to opposition groups fighting to overthrow the government.
83167>>0>> Egypt's state security prosecutors decided on Tuesday to detain for another 30 days an Egyptian who allegedly sold military information to Mossad, the Israeli secret service, security sources said. Samir Osman, 47, was arrested and held without charge five months ago, they said. Counter-espionage forces have said Osman met Mossad agents in Greece, Turkey and Hungary or by scuba diving to Israel from the border resort of Taba. Egyptian government newspapers said Osman had confessed to providing Mossad with information about the Egyptian navy and the place where he served in the Egyptian military. An Israeli-Arab textile merchant, Azam Azam, was arrested in November on suspicion of spying for Israel. An alleged Egyptian accomplice is in custody on suspicion of helping Azam and state security officials say they are also looking for two Israeli-Arab women who allegedly recruited him. Israel has denied Azam is a spy but Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak insists that he is and has rejected Israeli appeals that the Egyptian authorities release him.
83167>>0>> German public prosecutors are to step in on a dispute between Volkswagen AG and plant construction group ABB over the cost of a paint factory built for VW's Czech Skoda unit, VW and ABB said Friday. In a brief statement, Swiss-Swedish ABB said it had already contacted Zurich authorities over the matter and now planned to ask German prosecutors to get involved as well. VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said the German carmaker had been informed of ABB's move and supported it fully. Neither VW or ABB was prepared to give precise details on the nature of the dispute. Germany's Spiegel magazine earlier this week reported that ABB had paid out 10 million marks in bribes for a contract to build the Skoda paint plant. VW sources said that some 100 million marks of the total 400 million mark cost of the Czech plant was being disputed. That included the 10 million marks in alleged bribes, the sources said. VW's Kocks said ABB's decision to involve public prosecutors in the matter came at the direct instigation of VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech. ABB merely said it had passed on large amounts of information to representatives of the VW group to help it with its internal probe, but said it did not wish to hamper investigations by giving more details. -- Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Boehringer Mannheim Corp and Johnson & Johnson said they agreed to settle issues that led last year to claims and counterclaims alleging inappropriate competitive activity. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.   Boehringer on June 19 last year filed a lawsuit against J&J and its Lifescan unit alleging that Lifescan "illegally obtained a product prototype, infiltrated private Boehringer meetings and stole confidential documents." The six-count lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis. It alleged Lifescan engaged in industrial espionage against Boehringer for at least 17 months. The two companies compete in the diabetes care market. J&J acknowledged the Boehringer lawsuit and said an internal probe showed Lifescan gained no competitive advantage from information improperly obtained from Boehringer.   Boehringer is based in Indianapolis, but has much of its operations in Germany, as well as California and Maryland. The healthcare products company had 1995 sales of $700 million and is owned by privately held Corange Ltd, of Bermuda. New Brunswick, N.J.-based J&J is one of the world's largest healthcare products and pharmaceuticals manufacturers. It had 1996 sales of $21.62 billion. "Boehringer Mannheim and Johnson & Johnson are pleased that they were able to reach an out-of-court settlement, as they believe the settlement is in the best interest of both companies and their customers," the companies said jointly. Spokesmen for both companies said they were precluded from making further comment by the terms of the legal settlement. In its statement last summer, Boehringer said the industrial espionage allegedly occured between September 1992 and March 1994 at the direction of Lifescan executives. Boehringer said it was seeking compensatory damages from J&J in an unspecified amount. ((--Chicago Newsdesk 312-408-8787))
83167>>0>> The World Bank said it was willing to offer Yemen a soft loan of $60 million to set up a financial market and improve the country's banking system, a central bank official said. "Negotiations between the central bank and the World Bank started in Sanaa today (Tuesday) on the establishment of a financial market in Yemen and the enhancement of the banking and monetary system," the official told Reuters. He said the World Bank had already expressed its willingness to offer the loan in addition to providing technical support for the project. Yemen, one of the Arab World's poorest countries, has received soft loans from several countries and international organisations under an economic reform plan launched in March, 1995, in agreement with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG, heading toward a fresh legal dispute, said on Thursday it had suspended a purchasing department manager as part of an internal probe into bribery allegations at the German carmaker. VW spokesman Klaus Kocks said the employee, who was not identified, was suspended after the Wolfsburg-based carmaker said it found irregularities in contracts for the expansion of a paint factory at VW's Czech subsidary, Skoda Automobilova AS. Kocks said evidence from the employee's office has been secured but that a decision on whether to dismiss the employee would be made at the end of the investigation. VW started the probe after media reports said VW employees had demanded and received about 10 million marks in bribes relating to a contract awarded to Swiss-Swedish group ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd reported to be worth some 400 million marks. The VW investigation began just a week after VW settled a bitter three year legal battle with rival General Motors Corp and its German unit, Adam Opel AG, over allegations of industrial spying by a former top VW executive. GM and VW settled their dispute over GM's allegations that Jose Ignacio Lopez stole secret documents on parts prices, production plans and designs for future cars when he abruptly quit Detroit-based GM to join VW in March 1993. ABB last Friday said it has already contacted Swiss prosecutors and would also talk with German prosecutors. VW's Kocks said the carmaker had been informed of ABB's move and had supported it fully. VW sources have said some 100 million marks of the total 400 million marks in costs for the Czech plant was being disputed by ABB, including the alleged 10 million marks in bribes. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Britain's National Westminster banking group said on Friday it had withdrawn from its role as adviser to the Serbian government on negotiations with its international creditors. A spokeswoman said the decision had been made "due to the change in the international climate", adding there had been recent signs that Belgrade had moved away from commitments to economic liberalisation and democratisation.   "We have indicated to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that due to the change in the international climate we are unable to proceed with our advisory work with them on sovereign debt negotiations," the spokeswoman said. She said however the group would continue with technical work on the privatisation of Serbia's PTT telecommunications agency. The spokeswoman said Serbia had given commitments to greater economic and political liberalism at the time of the Dayton negotiations which brought peace to Bosnia, but added "recent actions by the republic have show a move away from that commitment". Douglas Hurd, who stepped down as British foreign secretary in July 1995, is deputy chairman of National Westminster's NatWest Capital Markets subsidiary, which was advising Serbia on its debt.
83167>>0>> An FBI official said on Friday that about 200 espionage cases remain under investigation and that resources devoted to catching spies in Washington, D.C. have increased since the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union. Raymond Mislock, in charge of the national security division at the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Washington field office, told reporters that the Russians "still are on the scene," and continue to employ intelligence officers in this country. Asked about the 1993 disclosure in the book "The FBI" by Ronald Kessler that the law enforcement agency was investigating 200 spy cases, Mislock replied, "The number is extremely high. That's a good number." In November, the FBI arrested CIA officer Harold Nicholson, a 16-year veteran and the highest-ranking CIA officer ever indicted on espionage charges. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of spying for Russia since mid-1994. A court hearing in the case, which was set for trial in March, has been scheduled for Monday. The FBI last month arrested one of its own agents, Earl Pitts, charging him with selling national security secrets to Moscow since 1987. Mislock said the Russians were not the only country to pose an espionage threat to the United States, calling it a "broad-based threat."
83167>>0>> NEW YORK - U.S. stocks ended mixed on profit-taking on Friday but bond prices jumped -- sending interest rates lower -- after the government reported a surge in economic growth but little inflation at the end of last year. In the stock market, investors took profits in high-flying blue chips and shifted funds into small companies, boosting the lagging Nasdaq market. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 10.77 points to 6,813.09 after racking up two straight days of gains. For the week, the index was up 116.61 points.   The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.83 points to 1,379.85, ending up 16.01 points for the week. In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,380 to 1,098 on heavy volume of 574 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. LONDON - The FTSE 100 share index burst into record territory as signs that the Dow's bull run was back on track inspired British shares to bound ahead. The FTSE closed at an all time high of 4,275.8, up 47.4 points on the day and 57 points since the start of the week.   FRANKFURT - Strong results from software firm SAP AG and further gains on Wall Street spurred the German share market to new records. The 30-share DAX index ended floor trade at a record close of 3,035.15 points, a rise of 17.83 points on the day and 36.91 since last Friday. Later, the IBIS DAX ended the late electronic trading session up 19.05 points, also at a record of 3,037.70. PARIS - Shares set a closing record, finishing up 0.54 percent, boosted by a rise on Wall Street and U.S. growth data which lowered inflation concern in the United States. The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 13.50 points at 2,516.56 but off an all-time intra day high of 2,521.88. This week the CAC-40 gained 86.22 points. ZURICH - Shares shot to new highs, extending recent gains, as a four percent jump in index heavyweight Roche drove the blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) to a record close. The SMI closed up 63.1 points, or 1.5 percent, at 4,272.2, after setting an all-time high of 4,272.4 during the session. The broad SPI gained 38.95 points to close at the day's high of 2,728.33 which was also a record close and a gain of 88.86 on the week.   TOKYO - Stocks bounced back sharply, turning around the previous day's decline of over 2.5 percent. Massive short-covering was triggered by a comment by U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan that Japan is overly pessimistic about its economy. The benchmark Nikkei average of 225 leading shares ended up 465.97 points at 18,330.01, a rise of 640.65 on the week. HONG KONG - Strength in banking and utility stocks allowed Hong Kong stocks to end with modest gains but the market's recent soft tone kept investors cautious and analysts said interest rates still remained a concern. The Hang Seng Index rose 33.39 points to 13,321.79. Over the week it shed 57.76 points or 0.43 percent. SYDNEY - A mixed share market muddled its way to a firmer close as Dow-inspired strength in the industrials managed to overcome a resources sector weakened by soft precious and base metals prices. Option exercises following Thursday's January series expiry inflated otherwise modest turnovers. The All Ordinaries index added 6.0 points to 2,423.7, a slight rise of 0.7 from last Friday.   JOHANNESBURG - Industrial shares shunned Wall Street's rich overnight gains to trade weaker during the morning before being pulled higher by futures trade to finish strong. Industrials finished the day 40.7 points higher at 8,003.3, down 39.5 on the week. The all-share index closed 17.9 points higher at 6,676.1 a loss of 8.5 since last Friday. Gold shares struggled throughout the day to stifle their fall on the back of dull bullion. The gold index finished 15.3 points lower at 1,350.0 down 20.4 from last weeks close.

83167>>0>> President Boris Yeltsin said on Tuesday Russia must defend its state interests better after hearing a report from his counter-intelligence chief saying foreign spying had increased significantly. Nikolai Kovalyov, head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), told Yeltsin that 11 foreign spies had been uncovered in the last six months and 32 Russians had been caught in the same period trying to hand over secret information. "Information was presented bearing witness to a significant rise in the activities of foreign special services on Russian territory," presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing. "The president pointed to the need to improve the mechanisms for defending Russia's state interests." Yastrzhembsky gave no others details. Moscow's security services have said several times in recent years that foreign intelligence networks are still operating against Russia despite the end of the Cold War. Washington says Moscow is still active as well. An official at the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said last week it was still investigating about 200 espionage cases and that resources spent on catching spies in Washington had increased since the Soviet Union's collapse. In November, the FBI arrested Harold Nicholson, the highest-ranking Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer indicted so far on espionage charges. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of spying for Russia since mid-1994. The FBI arrested another of its own agents, Earl Edwin Pitts, the following month for allegedly selling U.S. security secrets to Russia since 1987. Pitts denies the charge. Britain and Russia expelled four diplomats each last year in a spying row.
83167>>0>> A Cairo court remanded an Egyptian man in custody for another 45 days while the prosecutor investigates allegations that he was part of an Israeli spy ring, security sources said on Tuesday. In November, Egyptian security forces arrested Emaddedin Abdel Hamid along with alleged Israeli spy Azam Azam who is also in detention. They are now looking for two Arab-Israeli women also implicated in the case. Both men, who deny the espionage allegations, have not been formally charged and no date has been set for a trial. The prosecutor has said that Azam had facilitated a sexual affair between Abdel Hamid and one of the women who later recruited him. Among prosecution evidence were clothes said to produce invisible ink when washed. Israel has insisted that Azam is innocent and demands his release. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak says that he is a spy and that Israel squandered the chance to secure his release through quiet diplomacy by making the affair public. Egypt in 1979 became the first Arab state to sign a peace treaty with Israel but ties have cooled sharply since right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June. The prosecutor is also holding in detention another Egyptian man who allegedly sold military information to the Mossad, the Israeli secret service.
83167>>0>> Electrical engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG has filed criminal charges alleging blackmail in the case involving bribery allegations at German car maker Volkswagen AG (VW), ABB spokesman Volker Leichsering said. The spokesman said the charges were filed late last week with Zurich prosecutors, but he declined to identify against whom or which company they were filed. 'It's against someone or some institution," the spokesman said in response to inquiries, confirming that the charge was connected with VW. Another charge, that is "linked" to the charge filed in Zurich, will also be filed in Germany in the short term. VW started a probe after media reports alleged VW employees had demanded and received bribes relating to a contract awarded to ABB to build a paint plant at VW's Czech Skoda unit. Last week an ABB spokesman said there was a difference of opinion over the total cost of executing the Skoda paint job. VW sources have said that some 100 million marks ($61 million) of the total 400 million mark cost of the Czech plant was being disputed. That includes 10 million marks in alleged bribes, the VW sources said. VW suspended a purchasing department manager as part of the internal probe into bribery alegations. -- Peter Nielsen, Zurich Editorial +41 1 631 7340 ($ = 1.640 German Marks)

83167>>0>> Human rights and environmental groups are urging Moscow to drop espionage charges against a former Russian naval captain, who last year brought to light radioactive pollution left by the Russian fleet in the Arctic and Pacific Oceans. The fifty groups, including Sierra Club, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch, asked U.S. Vice President Al Gore to raise the case of Aleksandr Nikitin in his meeting on Thursday with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. In letters sent on Jan. 31 to Gore and Chernomyrdin, the groups said charges against Nikitin should be dismissed, and he should be allowed to travel freely. They said they were "deeply concerned about the Russian government's current charges against Aleksandr Nikitin in an attempt to keep secret the nuclear hazards caused by the Russian North Sea Fleet." Nikitin was held in prison for six months without charges "on suspicion of espionage and revealing state secrets, crimes possibly punishable by death," the U.S. State Department said last week in its world human rights report, citing the case as "fraught with numerous violations of due process." He was released in December but has not been allowed to leave St. Petersburg. "It's an ongoing concern of ours," said a State Department official, who said the issue might be raised in a private session between Gore and Chernomyrdin. Nikitin's work was important in alerting the world to a major problem with "disastrous implications for other countries sharing these waters," the groups said.
83167>>0>> Up to 35 people were feared drowned on Friday after a boat powered by an outboard motor capsized in Lake Victoria, leaving survivors clinging to hunks of wood, jerrycans and baskets of fish. Police spokesman Peter Kimanthi said only four bodies were recovered from Africas largest lake on Wednesday and there were five survivors. But he had no confirmed death toll. He said it remained unclear how many passengers were on board but police suspected the boat had been overloaded. Kenyan newspapers put the number of dead from the capsize at about 35. "The 35 perished in the deep waters of the lake during high tides...The dead included the boats owner and three members of his family," said the Kenya Times newspaper, owned by Kenyas ruling party. Survivors clung to pieces of wood, jerrycans and baskets loaded with fish after the boat, powered by an outboard engine, capsized about 40 km (25 miles) from the western Kenyan port of Homa Bay. The boat was loaded with bags of maize and sugar, Kimanthi said. He said the boat was used as a passenger vessel on the lake and had left its first port on Wednesday with 35 passengers. But police suspected the vessel had picked up other passengers at three towns it called in at before sinking. The Kenya Times quoted a port official at Homa Bay as saying the boat, the Owila, picked up more people and more cargo at its second stop. Officials appealed to the Kenyan navy to help in rescue work. More than 600 people were killed in May last year in the worst shipping disaster on Lake Victoria when the Tanzanian -owned ferry Bukoba capsized and sank in 27 metres (90 feet) of water. A total of 403 bodies were recovered but survivors said the ferry was grossly overloaded with more than 1,000 people aboard. A government inquiry blamed the ships owners, the state -owned Tanzania Railways Corporation, for operating an unstable ship and said its marine operations were characterised by gross negligence, inefficiency, corruption and other malpractices. Disasters involving overloaded boats are common on the lake, covering 70,000 square km (27,000 square miles) from Uganda in the north to Tanzania in the south and Kenya in the east.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG said on Monday it had asked German prosecutors to investigate growing bribery allegations tied to a major paint factory contract for its Czech Skoda unit awarded to Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri . VW said it filed the legal complaint on Friday to start the criminal probe into allegations that some VW workers demanded about 20 million marks in bribes from ABB in exchange for the 400 million mark plant expansion contract. The request to prosecutors in Braunschweig came as Der Spiegel magazine said a group of workers at VW and General Motors Corp for years have sought and received hundreds of millions of marks in bribes from several parts suppliers. The allegations add to the mounting troubles for Volkswagen, emerging only a few weeks after VW agreed to end GM's lawsuit charging that former GM executive Jose Ignacio Lopez had stolen thousands of secret documents when he left to join VW in March 1993. VW sought to solve its troubles over Lopez, credited with returning VW to profitability, by agreeing to pay GM about $100 million and buy $1 billion of parts over the next seven years. Swiss prosecutor Urs Hubmann said on Monday that he questioned two people last week as part of the probe, which was requested by ABB after the allegations surfaced in January. But Hubmann declined to identify the people who were questioned in Zurich and would not confirm or deny the details of the Spiegel report. The report said funds from such bribes, which were demanded during negotiations for contracts, were allegedly paid to shell companies in Luxembourg, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. A VW spokesman declined to comment directly on the allegations made in the magazine report, saying the German carmaker would cooperate with the various investigations. An ABB spokesman in Zurich on Monday also declined to comment on the Spiegel allegations about a gang of bribe-takers dubbed "the Network", saying ABB had contacted prosecutors in Switzerland and Germany for help and that it has given full information to VW to help with their own internal probe. "It is in the hands of the legal authorities completely now," spokesman Michael Robertson told Reuters. "We do not want to comment in any way that could disturb their investigations." An official at GM's European office in Zurich said the U.S. auto giant was monitoring the investigation and that it would contact public prosecutors if it suspected any wrongdoing. The official said GM executives did not meet with VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech at the recent World Economic Summit in Davos, saying, "There have been no discussions with VW managers or with Piech on such an issue." --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG said Monday it asked German prosecutors to investigate growing bribery allegations tied to a major paint factory contract for its Czech Skoda unit awarded to Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri. VW said it filed the legal complaint on Friday to start the criminal probe into allegations that some VW workers demanded about 20 million German marks ($12 million) in bribes from ABB in exchange for the 400 million mark ($238 million) plant expansion contract.

83167>>0>> A detained Israeli man will stand trial in Egypt with three other people on charges of spying for Israel and damaging Egypt's national interests, officials said on Monday. The case of Azam Azam, a 35-year-old chief mechanic at an Israeli-owned factory in Egypt who was arrested in November, has caused friction in already strained Egyptian-Israeli relations. Israel said he was innocent and appealed for his release but Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said that once Israel made the case public he could not interfere with the legal system. The other defendants in the espionage case are 34-year-old Egyptian Emad Abdelhamid Ismail and two Israeli women who are not in Egypt -- Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna. Egypt's prosecutor general on Monday referred the four to trial and issued the charge sheet, which says Ismail agreed to help the two women spy for Israel's intelligence service Mossad. The prosecution alleged that Ismail worked with Mossad from March to October last year. Greiss, with whom he was having an affair according to the prosecution, gave Ismail $650 when he was recruited and Shawahna offered to pay him $1000 per month if he helped Mossad, the charge sheet said. Azam's alleged role in the espionage case was to deliver to Ismail women's underwear inscribed with invisible ink. The prosecution has not said what kind of information Israel was seeking. Ismail "received the necessary training to carry out his assignments with the intention of harming the state's interest", the charge sheet said. It said Azam and Ismail had both confessed to the charges. But Azam denied the espionage charges in December in his first public appearance in an Egyptian court for a hearing to extend his detention. The charge sheet said that Ismail told interrogators he was recruited when he went to Israel last February to train at a women's garments factory. The Egyptian told interrogators he became acquainted with Greiss at the factory and that shortly afterwards she began taking him out to have sex with him in her car. Ismail said he felt at the time that they were being photographed. He told interrogators that Greiss asked him many questions about Egypt and conditions there after he agreed to work with Mossad. National Security Authority investigators said they had recorded telephone calls between Ismail and Greiss in which he agreed to obey Mossad orders to go to Hungary, after which he would go to Israel. The sources said the four would face trial in the Supreme State Security Court and that public prosecutor Raga el-Arabi would ask for the harshest possible sentence, which would be life imprisonment with hard labour. A date for the trial has not yet been set. Egypt became the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in 1979 but relations have cooled significantly since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June.
83167>>0>> Egypt will put on trial detained Israeli Azam Azam and three other people on charges of spying for Israel and damaging Egypt's national interests, official sources said on Monday. The others are 34-year-old Egyptian Emad Abdelhamid Ismail and two Israeli women who are not in Egypt -- Mona Ahmed Shawahna and Zahra Youssef Greis. Azam, who was working at an Israeli-owned textile factory in Cairo, was detained in November on suspicion of spying. Israel said he was innocent and appealed for his release but Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said that once Israel made the case public he could not interfere with the legal system. The charge sheet says Ismail agreed to help the two women to spy for the Israeli intelligence service Mossad. One of the women, with whom he was having an affair, gave Ismail $650 when he was recruited and the other offered him $1000, the charge sheet said. Azam's role in the espionage case was to deliver to Ismail women's underwear inscribed with invisible ink. The prosecution has not said what kind of information Israel was seeking. The sources said the four would face trial in the Supreme State Security Court and that public prosecutor Raga el-Arabi would ask for the harshest possible sentences. A date for the trial has not yet been set.

83167>>0>> Carmaker Volkswagen AG said on Monday it asked German prosecutors to probe bribery allegations tied to the construction of a paint factory for its Czech Skoda subsidiary by Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG. VW said it filed the complaint on Friday with prosecutors in Braunschweig, which is near the corporate headquarters Wolfsburg, as a way to start the investigation in Germany.   VW asks Germans to probe Czech plant =2 VW said it filed the complaint in order to start the investigation tied to allegations in media reports that workers in its purchasing department sought kickbacks from ABB for the expansion of the paint factory in the Czech Republic. The carmaker in late January said it had suspended a purchasing department manager as part of a probe of reports that some 20 million marks ($12 million) of bribes were paid by ABB to get the deal worth some 400 million marks. VW also said its statement came after a report in Monday's Der Spiegel magazine that said payments were made to a network of workers at both VW and General Motors Corp who sought kickbacks from parts suppliers, including for the ABB contract. ABB has already contacted Swiss authorities and has also asked German prosecutors to launch an investigation. VW has said it fully supports ABB's move. --Frankfurt Newsroom +49 69 756525 ($ = 1.692 German Marks)
83167>>0>> The protracted truckers' strike in Spain took a more serious tone on Tuesday for two major German carmakers who announced a new round of production stoppages affecting thousands more workers. Adam Opel AG, the German unit of U.S. carmaker General Motors Corp, said the Spanish strike has now affected about 20,000 members of its workforce and has so far prevented the production of some 11,000 vehicles. Volkwagen AG, which is Europe's largest carmaker, said it would stop all production of its Polo model at the main Wolfsburg plant as of Tuesday night, preventing production of about 1,000 vehicles a day and affecting about 3,500 workers. Spain's government has voiced concern that Spain is at risk of losing lucrative contracts due to the 13-day-old strike, which has prevented Opel and VW from receiving parts on the "just-in-time" system that requires prompt delivery shortly before the parts are put into the production process. Carmakers have depleted their reserves, forcing them to shut down production at plants both in Germany and Spain. But officials at both carmakers said the truckers' strike would not prompt them to review contracts with Spanish manufacturers or prompt a wave of doubts about existing parts delivery practices. A General Motors official in Zurich said the U.S. carmaker, which produces the Opel and Vauxhall brands in Europe, would not contemplate changing its supplier contracts in Spain over a mere labour strike, noting labour troubles affect all countries of the European Union at one time or another. "There's always the possiblity of some work stoppage in any European country. There can be a strike anywhere. Those kinds of things are part and parcel of democratic processes," the GM official said from GM's European corporate headquarters. The leader of VW's works council said in a radio interview on Tuesday that the "just-in-time" delivery system kept down the cost of new vehicles but that VW must also secure more contracts with local parts suppliers as a back-up system. VW has not felt the brunt of the strike as heavily as Opel but said no end to the strike by the weekend would force it to stop production of the popular Golf model next week, which would affect a total of 20,000 VW workers in Germany. "The Golf vehicle production can be sustained through the end of the week," a VW spokesman said. "But if the strike goes on into next week, we will certainly have worse troubles." Though traffic was flowing freely in most parts of Spain by Tuesday, many plants, especially those of carmakers, were forced to cut back or halt production for lack of supplies. And once the strike ends, truckers will need at least two to three days to reach Germany and carmakers another few days to restart operations and replenish supplies. VW and Opel both said they did not expect any long-term impact on sales due to the strike, saying many of the cars that cannot be produced at the moment have already been sold and that customers may have to wait an extra one or two weeks. After the strike in Spain ends, Opel said it planned to make up the lost production through additional shifts that are allowed through flexible work contracts. Among individual plants, Opel said production at its Eisenach plant would suspend production of the Corsa vehicle for the night shift on Thursday and the first day shift, affecting 1,000 workers and production of 500 vehicles. The carmaker will also suspend production at its component factory in Kaiserslautern on Friday, affecting about 4,000 workers. But Opel said it would go forward with a planned ceremony to mark the five-millionth engine to be produced at the factory scheduled for Thursday. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> General Motors Corp executives said Wednesday that they are not aware of any involvement by current GM employees in an investigation of alleged kickbacks demanded by former Volkswagen AG production chief J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and his followers. GM Chairman Jack Smith said the company was asked by the U.S. investigators to look at certain supplier contracts following Volkswagen's decision to seek criminal charges Friday relating to alleged kickbacks demanded from Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB.   GM is cooperating with the request from the Justice Departent investigators. "We don't know anything about that other than that this has surfaced in this Volkswagen-ABB transaction, and so as I understand it we've been asked to look at what happened inside GM," Smith said in a news conference following a speech to the Economic Club of Detroit. Reports in Germany over the weekend suggested that VW and GM may have been linked in a so-called "network" of purchasing managers who allegedly demanded kickbacks on contracts.   But a source familiar with the U.S. investigation said the request made to GM was considered an extension of the U.S. Justice Department's criminal investigation of Lopez and his followers and did not involve any current GM employees. GM's purchasing chief, Harold Kutner, earlier on Wednesday told Reuters that none of his staff was known to be involved in the probe.  "I have no knowledge of any General Motors employees being involved in that," Kutner told Reuters at a parts supplier conference here. "I don't know about what went on during the Lopez era," he added.   Kutner replaced Lopez as GM's head of worldwide purchasing after Lopez and several of his followers abruptly left GM in 1993 to join Volkswagen. Lopez and three others face criminal charges in Germany over allegations that they stole confidential documents from GM and its Adam Opel AG subsidiary in Germany when they joined Volkswagen, including documents on GM supplier prices. A similar investigation by the U.S. Justice Department is continuing, but no charges have been filed. Smith said GM instituted a strict new ethics policy last year to help prevent wrongdoing by employees.   The policy clearly spells out unethical behavior and contains strict prohibitions on employees accepting gifts and meals from suppliers. But he admitted that the policy is not foolproof. "If somebody really wants to cheat and steal, that won't stop them," Smith said. "Then we've obviously hired the wrong person." Asked if hiring Lopez ultimately turned out to be a mistake for GM, Smith declined comment.  Lopez, who left Volkswagen late last year before German charges were filed against him, was credited with helping to dramatically lower purchasing costs for both automakers in the 1980s and '90s.
83167>>0>> German carmaker Volkswagen AG intends to cut about 10 percent of its international workforce by the year 2001 amid expectations for profits to keep rising, a magazine said on Wednesday. Germany's "Capital" magazine, citing an internal VW strategic planning report, said the carmaker wants to reduce its workforce to 215,000 from the current level of 240,000 workers by 2001, including 15,000 jobs in Germany. A VW spokesman declined comment on the magazine report. The internal report also said VW expects a 1997 group profit from 700 million marks ($414.3 million) and for sales to rise to 108 billion marks from 101 billion marks in 1996. Sales to dealers in 1997 were expected to reach 4.035 million vehicles compared with 3.7 million vehicles in 1996. In addition for 1997, VW expects pre-tax profit to rise to 2.1 billion marks from 1.9 billion marks in 1996. The magazine also said VW's operating profit for 1997 should rise to 3.7 billion marks from 2.7 billion marks in 1996 and reach 6.8 billion marks in 2001. VW said in December that its 1996 net profit would be clearly above the 1995 level of 336 million marks, bolstered by 1996 sales rising about 14 percent to 100 billion marks. For the year 2001, VW plans to report annual sales of about 127 billion marks for a return on sales of 3.2 percent. VW management board chairman Ferdinand Piech has called on the Wolfsburg-based carmaker to reach a return on sales of at least 6.5 percent. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525 ($ = 1.689 German Marks)

83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG said on Thursday it had fired a purchasing department employee and that he had been put under investigative custody by German public prosecutors. The Wolfsburg-based carmaker said the man was recently dismissed for allegedly submitting falsified or unwarranted contracts after they were discovered during an internal probe. VW spokesman Klaus Kocks declined to say whether the man, said to be a long-time employee, was part of a probe into charges that VW workers demanded and received bribes for a contract to expand a paint factory for VW's Czech Skoda unit. But sources close to the investigation said the man has been linked to the probe into charges some VW employees demanded and received about 20 million marks in bribes to award a 400 million mark paint factory contract to Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB AG/AB. VW has previously announced that another VW employee was suspended in late January as part of a VW probe into bribery allegations about the contract awarded to a German unit of ABB. Meanwhile, public prosecutors in Braunschweig, which is near VW's headquarters in Wolfsburg, said on Thursday they have begun a probe into the activities of two unidentified people. VW on Monday asked prosecutors in Braunschweig to begin the probe after a report in Der Spiegel magazine this week detailed allegations of corruption at VW and Adam Opel, the German unit of General Motors Corp. Swiss prosecutors this week also detained two people for allegedly trying to seek one million marks, the balance of a 20 million mark payment, from ABB officials. Prosecutors have said the two men appeared to have played minor roles. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> A Cairo court on Thursday decided to detain for another 45 days an Egyptian who allegedly sold military information to Israel's secret service Mossad, security sources said. Samir Osman, 47, was arrested and held without charge six months ago, they said. Counter-espionage forces have said Osman met Mossad agents in Greece, Turkey and Hungary or by scuba diving to Israel from the border resort of Taba. Egyptian government newspapers said Osman had confessed to providing Mossad with information about the Egyptian navy and the place where he served in the Egyptian military. In another case, Egypt's prosecutor general on Monday referred detained Israeli Azam Azam and three other people to trial on charges of spying for Israel and damaging Egypt's national interests. The case of Azam, chief mechanic at an Israeli-owned factory in Egypt who was arrested in November, has caused friction in already strained Egyptian-Israeli relations. Israel's foreign ministry on Thursday summoned Egypt's ambassador to make clear it wanted Azam to be released, a ministry spokesman said.
83167>>0>> Israel's Foreign Ministry on Thursday summoned Egypt's ambassador to make clear it wanted an Israeli man charged in Cairo with spying to be released, a ministry spokesman said. "I don't know if I could call it a formal complaint but Israel's position will be made clear," spokesman Ygal Palmor told Reuters before the 11 a.m. (0900 GMT) meeting with Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny. "The man had nothing to do with any intelligence operation and of course the conclusion is he should be set free." Egyptian officials said on Monday that Azam Azam, 35, would stand trial with three other people on charges of spying for Israel and damaging Egypt's national interests. The case of Azam, chief mechanic at an Israeli-owned factory in Egypt who was arrested in November, has caused friction in already strained Egyptian-Israeli relations.

83167>>0>> Three major German carmakers said on Thursday they have or soon will resume production after Spanish truck drivers ended a two-week walkout, allowing parts to be delivered to the idled production plants. The carmakers, who ran into trouble because parts could not be delivered for "just-in-time" production methods where parts arrive only a few hours or days before their use, said additional shifts would be added to make up for lost output. Mercedes-Benz AG said it began again on Thursday making vehicles and vehicle parts at its two Spanish factories after the two-week strike was ended on Wednesday night. Production of about 1,000 of Mercedes' V-Class transporters was affected by the week-long stoppage in production at a plant in Vitoria and also at a parts production plant in Barcelona. Adam Opel AG, a unit of General Motors Corp, said it would resume producton at two German plants from Monday. Volkswagen AG said it would resume some production of its Polo vehicle at its Wolfsburg and Pamplona plants on Friday. It added that output of the Golf model had not been affected by the strike. Opel said production of the Vectra saloon would resume at its plant in Ruesselsheim on Monday since parts deliveries from Spain would take a few days to reach the Frankfurt area plant. At Opel's plant in Bochum, the spokesman said production would resume on Monday for the Astra vehicle. Opel also planned to resume production of the Corsa vehicle at its Eisenach facility on Friday, the official said. Opel on Tuesday said some 20,000 workers were affected by the suspension of production and that about 11,000 vehicles could not be built during the Spanish strike. At Volkswagen, the carmaker said it would resume some production of the Polo vehicle on Friday and that it expected parts supplies to stabilise and for normal operations to resume on Monday. VW began cutting production of the Polo last Tuesday and the carmaker said the shutdown prevented production of about 3,900 vehicles. German carmakers Audi AG, a unit of Volkswagen, and BMW AG said they did not suffer any impact from the Spanish strike. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> German carmaker Volkswagen AG said on Sunday it would do everything in its power to clear up allegations of widespread corruption in the German car industry. "VW wants to clear up a possible swamp of corruption in the supplies sector," VW spokesman Klaus Kocks told Reuters. He said VW had urged suppliers, including Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB, to initiate legal proceedings where necessary to clarify the corruption charges, which could have a negative affect on the whole German car industry. ABB filed charges related to the case earlier this month. Kocks declined comment on details of a report in Spiegel magazine which said former senior VW managers were implicated in a network of corruption, with purchasing managers allegedly receiving multi-million mark kickbacks from suppliers. But he did say VW would present further findings of its own internal investigations to public prosecutors in Braunschweig on Monday. VW said on Thursday it had fired a purchasing department department employee and that he had been placed in investigative custody by German public prosecutors. The carmaker said the man was recently dismissed for allegedly submitting falsified or unwarranted contracts after they were discovered during an internal probe. Kocks promised a "comprehensive explanation" of corruption allegations in a statement to be released on Wednesday at 1030 GMT. The VW spokesman welcomed legal proceedings initiated in Braunschweig and Zurich by ABB and said: "We need results which can be used in court." He said that the findings of VW's internal enquiry had in some cases been gathered by private investigators. The Spiegel report, released in advance of publication, pointed to a "network" of purchasing managers at both VW and General Motors who over years had amassed millions of marks in kickbacks from suppliers. Kocks said there was still no evidence of a network conspiracy among purchasing employees. "At the moment we can only see the pieces of the mosaic, not the whole picture." There was no evidence of any involvement by the group's former purchasing manager Jose Ignacio Lopez, he said. VW is currently investigating a series of possible corruption cases among its suppliers, including allegations that some suppliers charged higher invoices so as to cream off some of the excess cash.

83167>>0>> General Motors Corp.'s Delphi Automotive Systems unit wants to market itself to Wall Street in a possible initial public offering as primarily an electronics-driven parts firm, a Delphi official said Tuesday. "That's absolutely our objective," J.T. Battenberg, president of the unit, told reporters at the Society of Automotive engineers conference. He said a planned integration with Delco Electronics will take time, "but that's certainly our objective." Battenberg, a GM executive vice president, said the integration of electronics into Delphi's more traditional mechanical parts systems will speed up once Delco Electronics Corp. is fully merged into Delphi. At the nation's premier auto supplier show here, Delphi is touting its electronics expertise over its metal-bending capabilities, showing off "smart" air bag systems, computerized vehicle control and anti-skid systems and complete interior and instrumentation systems. "If you look out (into the future), electronics is becoming very pervasive," Battenberg said. GM has said previously that Kokomo, Ind.-based Delco, now a part of GM's Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiary, will become a seventh division of Delphi in connection with the $9.5 billion sale of Hughes' defence electronics business to Raytheon Co. GM will consider offering 20 percent of the combined Delco-Delphi to the public at a future date. Michael Burns, Delco Electronics' general manager, said he expects the integration process to be largely completed by the end of the third quarter. Even before any approvals have been granted for the Raytheon deal, Delphi and Delco already are combining the way they approach customers. Mercedes-Benz, for example, which once had Delphi and Delco calling on it separately, now will have one "customer manager" from the combined firms, Burns said. But he declined to offer specifics on how the Delco and Delphi staffs would be combined or whether any of Delco's 31,000 worldwide jobs would be eliminated. "We're going to try to maximize this enterprise in terms of growth, profitability and presence around the world," Burns said. Battenberg said Delphi still considers eight of its 191 plants as "troubled," but said GM's timetable for future public ownership in Delphi does not depend on repair of those operations. Still, Battenberg said Delphi is working hard to turn around unprofitable plants, such as two Dayton, Ohio, brake plants that staged a costly strike last year. "They are not making money. They're troubled, and we're trying to fix them," Battenberg said, adding that "everything is a possibility," including consolidation or closure. Separately, Battenberg said Delphi is now working closely with German automaker Volkswagen AG to determine the composition of $1 billion worth of GM parts that VW has agreed to buy to settle the Lopez industrial espionage dispute. "We've normalised relations with Volkswagen," Battenberg said. It's pretty much business as usual." VW agreed to buy an additional $1 billion worth of components from GM over the next seven years as a part of a deal to settle GM's lawsuit alleging that former VW production chief J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and others stole GM corporate secrets when they left GM to join VW in 1993. Battenberg declined to discuss the types of parts that VW may buy. The German automaker now buys about $300 million worth of GM parts annually, including a large portion of automobile wiring harnesses.

J.T. Battenberg, GM executive vice president in charge of the Delphi parts unit, said he recently met with VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech and added that the two executives had a "very good meeting."   "We've normalized relations with Volkswagen," Battenberg told reporters at the Society of Automotive Engineers conference here. "It's pretty much business as usual." Battenberg declined to reveal the types of components that Volkswagen may purchase from GM. He said teams of Delphi and VW personnel are now working on the project. Currently, VW buys about $300 million worth of Delphi parts a year, including a large portion of automobile wiring harnesses. The $1 billion of new parts purchases would be incremental business for Delphi, he said.   VW agreed to buy an additional $1 billion worth of components from GM over the next seven years as a part of a deal to settle GM's lawsuit over the actions of former purchasing executive J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. GM accused Lopez and others of stealing corporate secrets, including GM's supplier prices in Europe, when they left the Detroit automaker to join VW in 1993. Lopez, who resigned from VW in December, faces criminal charges in Germany and is the subject of ongoing investigations both in the United States and Germany. To settle GM's U.S. civil complaint, VW also agreed to pay GM $100 million in cash.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG, a day before it will announce a response to a growing bribery scandal, said on Tuesday that 1996 group profit doubled to 678 million marks ($405 million) on the back of a 14 percent rise in sales to 100.1 billion marks. VW said profit at the group level rose to 678 million marks from 336 million marks in 1995 and earnings at the parent level rose 54 percent to 630 million marks from 410 million marks. The Wolfsburg-based carmaker also proposed to its supervisory board that the dividend on 1996 results be raised to 318 million marks. The payout on ordinary shares would be raised to nine marks per share from six marks in 1995 and to 10 marks for preference shares from seven marks. But the carmaker said cash flow, viewed by analysts as a more transparent look at VW's health, rose a meagre 4.4 percent to 10.85 billion marks from 10.4 billion marks in 1995. "I suspect that they were a little light of where most people had assumed the figures would be," said John Lawson, analyst at Salomon Brothers in London. Lawson warned against reading too deeply into VW's results, known to be padded with provisions, saying VW was still performing better than its industry peers. "This company is still doing a lot better than its peer group and that will be influential in what happens to its share price in the future," Lawson said. VW did not say whether the results reflected the $100 million payment made to General Motors Corp as part of a deal reached in January to settle GM's lawsuit charging VW with industrial spying when it hired away purchasing guru Jose Ignacio Lopez in 1993 from the U.S. carmaker. Stock traders were unimpressed with the results, saying the profit figures were below market expectations and that they were more concerned about allegations of some VW employees demanding and receiving bribes from industry suppliers. VW shares fell as low as 795 marks in post-bourse IBIS electronic trade before ending the day down 3.25 marks at 798 marks. The 30-share DAX index, however, ended the day up 52.71 points at 3,233.34 points, a gain of 1.66 percent. A VW official confirmed on Tuesday that the carmaker would issue a statement on Wednesday about the bribery allegations, which centre on the alleged payment of 20 million marks in bribes in connection with a 400 million mark plant expansion contract for VW's Czech Skoda unit. Lopez, credited with helping to return VW to profitability, has been named by Germany's Der Spiegel magazine as being involved in the so-called "Network" that demanded five percent of a contract's value in kickbacks. A spokesman for Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, has declined comment on the magazine's allegations. VW on Monday turned over the findings of its internal probe into the allegations, which have so far led to the suspension of one worker and the firing of another who was being held in custody by prosecutors. Despite the fresh legal scandal for VW, analysts said the carmaker was on a path to higher profits compared with dire times in 1993 when the carmaker took a one billion mark charge for restructuring purposes. "We do know that Skoda has turned around, VW's Brazilian operations are doing well and North America probably remained a loss-maker but looks awfully better," one analyst said.

83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG, a day before it is to announce a response to a growing bribery scandal, said Tuesday that its group earnings more than doubled last year as sales expanded by 14 percent. VW said profit at the company level rose to 678 million marks ($405 million) from 336 million marks ($201 million) in 1995 and earnings at the parent level rose 54 percent to 630 million marks ($376 million) from 410 million marks ($245 million). The Wolfsburg-based automaker also proposed to its supervisory board that the dividend on 1996 results be raised to 318 million marks ($190 million). The payout on ordinary shares would be raised to 9 marks ($5.37) per share from 6 marks ($3.58) in 1995 and to 10 marks ($5.97) for preferred shares from 7 marks ($4.18). John Lawson, analyst at Salomon Brothers in London, warned against reading too deeply into VW's results, known to be padded with provisions, saying VW was still performing better than its industry peers.

VW did not say whether the results reflected the $100 million payment made to General Motors Corp. as part of a deal reached in January to settle GM's lawsuit charging VW with industrial spying when it hired away purchasing guru Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua in 1993 from the U.S. automaker. Stock traders were unimpressed with the results, saying the profit figures were below market expectations and that they were more concerned about allegations of some VW employees demanding and receiving bribes from industry suppliers. VW shares fell as low as 795 marks ($475) in after-hours electronic trading before ending the day down 3.25 marks ($1.94) at 798 marks ($476). A VW official confirmed Tuesday that the automaker would issue a statement Wednesday about the bribery allegations, which centre on the alleged payment of 20 million marks ($11.9 million) in bribes in connection with a 400 million mark ($229 million) plant expansion contract for VW's Czech Skoda unit.

83167>>0>> Some industry analysts on Wednesday said a drop in the price of Volkswagen AG shares due to disappointment about the German carmaker's 1996 results was unwarranted and reiterated their buy recommendations. VW on Tuesday said group profit rose 102 percent to 678 million marks on the back of a 14 percent rise in group sales to 100.1 billion marks. The Wolfsburg-based carmaker also proposed raising its dividend payout on ordinary shares to nine marks from six marks and on preference shares to 10 marks from seven marks. Dealers said the profit figure was below a number of market forecasts, prompting VW's shares to fall to as low as 789 marks before ending bourse trade down 6.50 marks at 791.50 marks. VW's shares in post-bourse IBIS trade kept paring gains and were trading at 793 marks. The following are summaries of comments made by analysts: HANS HARTMANN, DRESDNER KLEINWORT BENSON, FRANKFURT: Hartmann on Tuesday night repeated his buy recommendation on Volkswagen after the results were released. SABINE BLUEMEL, IMI SIGECO, LONDON: Bluemel, who maintained her buy recommendation on VW, said in a report that VW's profit figure was "well below" her forecast for 925 million marks and below market expectations for 800 million to one billion marks. But Bluemel said VW's conservative accounting methods and high provisioning made the results a poor measure of VW's general improvement. She said the dividend increase was positive and reflected VW's "optimistic outlook for business development" and revenue growth was higher than expectations and were above the growth in volume sales, which rose 13.6 percent to 3.76 million cars. Bluemel said she had left unchanged her earnings-per-share estimates for 1997 at 65 marks and for 1998 at 99 marks. HORST FREY, ABN AMRO, FRANKFURT: Frey, who has a buy rating on VW, said the carmaker had "hidden its profit" and that a lack of understanding about VW's accounting policies may have led to misunderstanding among some investors and that the carmaker has a strong potential. Frey said the dividend increases were a "positive surprise" for investors and that investors should be patient for the full impact of VW's turnaround strategy to take hold in 1998 as profit margins keep improving in 1997. He recommended "aggressive buying" of VW on any price dips. JUERGEN PIEPER, DEUTSCHE MORGAN GRENFELL, FRANKFURT: Pieper said the drop in VW shares was a false reaction to the results and kept his "overweight" recommendation on the carmaker along with his DVFA earnings per share forecast at 33 marks. He also expected the 1996 profit figure of 678 million marks to be reduced to about 470 million marks when subjected to the accounting standards under DVFA rules. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG said on Wednesday it did not yet have sufficient information to conclude whether allegations of corruption and bribery at the German carmaker had any foundation. VW said it would keep up its internal investigation into the allegations as well as cooperate with German prosecutors who have so far identified two people as being involved in demanding and receiving bribes in exchange for VW contracts. The carmaker on Monday turned over the findings of its internal investigation to prosecutors probing allegations that VW workers demanded about 20 million marks ($12 million) in kickbacks from Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB for a 400 million mark plant expansion contract for VW's Czech Skoda unit. "Volkswagen will strongly investigate all of the corruption allegations through its own probe and by involving the public prosecutors," VW said in a statement. VW had said at the weekend it would issue the statement on Wednesday. The carmaker again called on all suppliers to report any irregularities in dealings with the company and said that legal charges would be brought against any VW employee violating German laws in order to preserve supplier relationships. As part of the internal investigation, VW has so far suspended one employee and fired another worker who was then put in investigative custody by prosecutors in Braunschweig. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525 ($ = 1.670 German Marks)
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG said Wednesday that it did not have sufficient information to conclude whether allegations of corruption and bribery at the German carmaker had any foundation. On Monday the carmaker turned over to prosecutors the findings of an internal investigation of allegations that VW workers demanded about 20 million marks ($12 million) in kickbacks from Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB for a plant expansion contract for VW's Czech Skoda unit. VW, which recently settled a major dispute with General Motors Corp. over alleged corporate espionage by former GM employees, said it would continue its internal investigation into the allegations as well as cooperate with German prosecutors, who so far have identified two people as being involved in demanding and receiving bribes in exchange for VW contracts. "Volkswagen will strongly investigate all of the corruption allegations through its own probe and by involving the public prosecutors," VW said in a statement.

83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG, helped by strong performances in Brazil and Asia, said on Thursday sales in January surged 18.1 percent to 329,300 vehicles but it failed to attract a wave of new car buyers at home in Germany. The Wolfsburg-based carmaker said January sales in Germany rose two percent to 73,300 vehicles from 71,870 in January 1996, coming at the expense of hefty foreign growth that underpinned VW's 1996 profit doubling to 673 million marks ($399 million). Volkswagen said all of its brands contributed to the higher sales, which it said were driven by new vehicles that were launched in late 1996 and finally reaching major markets. VW said passenger car sales under the VW brand rose 15 percent to 212,500, while its Audi luxury brand rose 32 percent to 43,800. VW said sales at its Czech Skoda unit rose 7.5 percent to 18,100 and they rose 18 percent to 28,500 at Spanish-based SEAT. VW late last year launched a number of new vehicles, including a remodeled VW Passat saloon and the new Audi A3, a three-door model that has become the new entry point at VW's luxury car division. "The sales increase in January is clearly the result of our product offensive and the roll-out of new vehicles," a VW spokesman said. VW, which has sought to shrug off a fresh scandal involving allegations that VW workers demanded and received bribes from contractors, said it expected to maintain its international market position despite "rather subdued" industry conditions. But the carmaker has shown no sign of braking its desire to grab a bigger part of the west European vehicle market, where VW's sales excluding Germany last month rose 12.6 percent to 119,000 vehicles despite ongoing weak economic conditions. "VW is obviously continuing its rush for market share in 1997 and the January data confirms that," said Peter Schmidt, analyst at Automotive Industry Data in Tamworth, England. "The motivation is VW's belief that the European car market will soon be saturated and one can only increase sales by taking from rivals," he said. "They are taking advantage of their lower costs to cut prices and steal buyers from others." VW's sales in Brazil, a key market where the carmaker has production facilities, surged 45 percent to 57,400 vehicles, while sales in Japan rose 36 percent to 4,000 vehicles following a heavy bout of advertising and marketing. In North America, VW's sales rose 21 percent to 16,000 vehicles, while sales in China rose 60 percent to 22,600 vehicles where the carmaker is the No. 1 selling brand. Industry analysts said VW has been able to finance its international expansion by the impact of controversial production guru Jose Ignacio Lopez's cost-cutting measures at the carmaker having a greater impact on operations. Lopez, who resigned from VW last November in disgrace over allegations of industrial spying when he quit rival General Motors Corp in 1993 to join VW, sharply reduced the number of car platforms to a handful to streamline output.

83167>>0>> An FBI agent accused of selling U.S. national security secrets to Russia since 1987 has agreed to plead guilty, federal law enforcement sources said on Friday. They said a court hearing had been scheduled for later in the day in Alexandria, Virginia, for agent Earl Edwin Pitts, in which he would enter the guilty plea to the espionage charges.   Pitts, a 43-year-old lawyer and a 13-year FBI veteran, was arrested on Dec. 18 for allegedly selling secrets to Russia in exchange for $224,000. Pitts, only the second FBI agent to be arrested for alleged spying, was caught as a result of an FBI undercover operation. Pitts, who had been in the FBI's New York City unit responsible for catching Russian spies, has been charged with attempted espionage, conspiracy to commit espionage, communication of classified information and conveyance of government property without authorization. His trial had been scheduled for April 21, but a trial will no longer be needed because of the plea deal reached with prosecutors. A court appearance for Pitts was scheduled at 4 p.m. (2100 GMT) at the federal courthouse.
83167>>0>> Former FBI agent and supervisor Earl Pitts pleaded guilty on Friday to two espionage charges for selling secret U.S. national security security documents to Moscow from 1987 to 1996. Immediately after the court hearing, U.S. Attorney Helen Fahey held a news conference and announced that a guilty plea would be entered on Monday in a second major espionage case involving accused CIA spy Harold Nicholson. Fahey declined to give further details about the expected guilty plea by Nicholson, who has been accused of selling secrets to Moscow and was the highest ranking CIA official ever charged with espionage. Pitts, only the second FBI agent ever to be indicted for espionage in what has been called the most damaging spy case in FBI's 89-year history, admitted his guilt at a court hearing. Pitts, a 13-year FBI veteran, was arrested on Dec. 18 for passing vital national security secrets to Russian intelligence agencies in exchange for $224,000, betraying some of the FBI's most sensitive operations. Pitts, said to be motivated by the money, was caught as a result of a 16-month undercover FBI sting operation. He was dismissed by the FBI in January. U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis, who has presided over the case, accepted the guilty plea that had been negotiated by federal prosecutors and defence lawyers. Asked by the judge during the 90-minute hearing how he would plead, Pitts replied in a firm, clear voice, "Guilty, your honour." He stood before the judge wearing green prison garb. "Yes, your honour, I did," Pitts said, admitting he provided classified information to persons he believed to be agents of the Soviet Union and Russian governments. Pitts, who had been in the FBI's New York City unit responsible for catching Russian spies, was charged in a 12-count indictment with attempted espionage, conspiracy to commit espionage, communication of classified information and conveyance of government property without authorisation. In return for the guilty pleas to the two most-serious espionage charges, prosecutors agreed to drop the remaining 10 charges.    Pitts, 43, faces a maximum punishment of life in prison, a $500,000 fine and forfeiture of all money gained from his spying. Judge Ellis set sentencing for June 20 and said to Pitts, "It is uncertain exactly what sentence you will receive." Under federal sentencing guidelines defence attorneys said Pitts was expected to receive 15 to 20 years in prison. Justice Department officials had earlier confirmed the 20-year figure. A trial for Pitts had been scheduled for April 21. Prosecutors will avoid a trial, and the potential disclosure of classified information, because of the plea deal. According to court documents, Pitts spied for Moscow in New York from 1987 to 1992, and in 1995 and 1996 he dealt with U.S. agents posing as Russian spies in the undercover operation. His Soviet and Russian handlers paid him $124,000 and set up a $100,000 reserve fund in exchange for U.S. secrets, the FBI said. Pitts also received $65,000 from FBI agents during the sting operation. Law enforcement officials said Pitts, a lawyer, may have decided to negotiate the best deal possible because of the overwhelming evidence against him. They doubted whether Pitts has any information that would be of value to investigators in assessing the damage from his activities. Under the terms of the plea deal, Pitts agreed to cooperate with investigators and to submit to government lie-detector tests. If he tells the government all he knows, prosecutors agreed not to bring any further charges, including possible tax violations. One final condition of the plea agreement required Pitts to have no contact with any foreign government.
83167>>0>> Police in northwestern Iran have arrested 50 people on charges of spying, the official Iranian news agency IRNA said on Monday. It quoted the top security official in West Azerbaijan province as saying those arrested were members of six espionage networks who gave classified information to foreigners and took photographs of military areas. It did not say which foreign parties they spied for. "The spies have confessed to their crimes and have been tried at court," IRNA quoted the unnamed official as saying. It did not specify when the suspects had been arrested. Iran last year passed a law imposing the death sentence for espionage and singling out agents working for the United States and Israel. Iran's West Azerbaijan province borders on Azerbaijan, Turkey and Iraq.
83167>>0>> Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak refused on Wednesday to intervene in the case of Azam Azam, an Israeli detained in Egypt and about to face trial for spying. His case has added to the friction in Egyptian-Israeli ties at a time of high tensions following Israel's decision last week to build 6,500 new Jewish homes in Arab East Jerusalem. The Egyptian judge set Azam's trial date on the eve of a visit to Cairo by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Two of Azam's supporters accompanied Netanyahu to Cairo to plead the alleged spy's case. They said they visited Azam in prison on Wednesday and that he was being treated well. As'ad As'ad, an advisor to Netanyahu and a former member of the Knesset who is also, like Azam, a member of Israel's Druze community, told reporters he discussed Azam's case with Mubarak's senior political adviser Osama el-Baz. "I found Azam in good shape. Egyptian prison authorities are treating him well. I have faith in the Egyptian justice and judiciary," As'ad said. Asa'ad Arainy, municipal head of Azam's village, said he was confident Azam would be found innocent. "We told him the prime minister (Netanyahu) would discuss his case with President Mubarak," Arainy said. "It was clear from the beginning that Azam would stand in front of the Egyptian judiciary. We're not against this and we are sure of his innocence. God willing this will be apparent to the judges." At a joint conference with Netanyahu on Wednesday, Mubarak said the matter was out of his hands now that it had entered the judicial system. Netanyahu said on Tuesday that Azam, a 35-year-old chief mechanic who was working at an Israeli-owed factory in Egypt, was innocent and that the case would be at the top of his agenda in talks with Mubarak. Asked if he would agree to release the Israeli, Mubarak said: "This case is before the court. We have no authority to exclude it from the court until it comes to an end. Before that we are not authorised, even our constitution doesn't give us the right to do anything or to release him." Mubarak again said that Israeli publicity about Azam's case had damaged his chances and he compared it to an earlier incident in which the Egyptian authorities discreetly set free two suspected Israeli spies. "With the last one (Azam) there is definite proof according to the investigation done by the court. So that's why we could not release him," he said. "The first two were released before going through the media. When the media declared about Azam, we were in a position not to leave him and he should defend himself. If he is innocent, he is going to be released without any problem," he added. Netanyahu stood to Mubarak's side but did not comment on the espionage case throughout the news conference. But late on Tuesday he said: "Azam Azam is at the top of my agenda... He has been jailed on a false charge of espionage, or assisting in espionage for Israel. He is not an agent of any of the Israeli intelligence organs -- I can guarantee that. He is not an indirect agent." "He is nothing as far as Israeli intelligence is concerned. He is an Israeli citizen who has been falsely accused and we want him out," he added. On Tuesday the Egyptian judiciary set April 24 as the date for the start of Azam's trial. The case includes three other defendants -- an Egyptian man and two Israeli women who will be tried in absentia because they are not in Egypt. Egypt became the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in 1979 but relations have cooled significantly since Netanyahu took office in June.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG chief executive Ferdinand Piech said on Tuesday an internal probe of allegations of a widespread "network" of corruption at the German carmaker has so far shown that it does not exist. Piech, in his first public comments about allegations that some VW employees have demanded and received bribes in return for contracts, said the carmaker's probe has so far turned up only one employee who has since been suspended. "We do not yet have an indication of a network. We have so far identified one employee at Volkswagen and he has been suspended," Piech told Reuters at the Geneva car show. Piech also said the corruption allegations, which are centred on a plant expansion contract for VW's Czech Skoda unit that was awarded to Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB, involved "a nearly double-digit sum in the millions of marks". Piech said the amount in dispute with ABB involved VW paying an extra 5.7 million marks for one contract and losing another 3.7 million marks that ABB should have paid for delays, if they had been notified in time of the project deadline. "We do not think comments are appropriate at this time since the matter is under investigation by the relevant authorities," an ABB spokesman in Zurich said Wednesday. ABB made allegations last December that a VW employee had demanded bribes for the Skoda contract and that it would not pay the disputed costs, prompting both companies to contact German and Swiss public prosecutors. The figures involved are well below German media reports that have said the contract was worth some 400 million marks and included bribes of about 20 million marks. VW officials on Wednesday said the carmaker's purchasing division in the summer of 1994 had approved a 74 million mark contract for the Skoda paint factory and a second contract worth 38 million marks to expand the facility. German prosecutors in Braunschweig have said they were investigating two suspects as part of their probe at VW, brought about by the carmaker in a formal legal request. Sources close to the investigation said the VW employee who has been suspended is a long-time employee. Another VW employee, who was involved with transporting VW's test vehicles, has been put in investigative custody by prosecutors on allegations of filing false expense accounts. "It is not clear yet whether this person is involved with these allegations of corruption but we doubt it," the source told Reuters. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

83167>>0>> An Egyptian judge set April 24 for the start of the trial of an Israeli man and three other people on charges of spying for Israel and damaging Egypt's national interests, judicial sources said on Wednesday. The Israeli man is Azam Azam, a 35-year-old chief mechanic at an Israeli-owned factory in Egypt, arrested in November. His case has added to the friction in Egyptian-Israeli relations and the judge set the trial date on the eve of a visit to Cairo by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel says Azam is innocent and has called for his release but President Hosni Mubarak said that once Israel made the case public he could not interfere with the legal system. An Egyptian, Emad Abdelhamid Ismail, 34, and two Israeli women who are out of Egypt -- Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna -- are the other defendants in the case. The Supreme State Security Court will try the four at the South Cairo court building. Security sources have said the public prosecutor will ask for the harshest possible sentence, which would be life imprisonment with hard labour. The prosecutor general referred the four to trial after issuing the charge sheet, which says Ismail agreed to help the two women spy for Israel's intelligence service Mossad. The prosecution alleged that Ismail worked with Mossad from March to October last year. Greiss, with whom the prosecution says he was having an affair, gave Ismail $650 when he was recruited and Shawahna offered to pay him $1,000 a month if he helped Mossad, the charge sheet said. Azam's alleged role in the espionage case was to deliver to Ismail women's underwear inscribed with invisible ink. The prosecution has not said what information Israel was seeking. Ismail "received the necessary training to carry out his assignments with the intention of harming the state's interest", the charge sheet said. It said Azam and Ismail had both confessed. But Azam denied the espionage charges in December in his first public appearance in an Egyptian court for a hearing to extend his detention. The charge sheet said Ismail told interrogators he was recruited when he went to Israel last February to train at a women's garments factory. The Egyptian told interrogators he became acquainted with Greiss at the factory and shortly afterwards began taking him out to have sex in her car. Egypt became the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in 1979 but relations have cooled significantly since Netanyahu took office in June.
83167>>0>> On a blustery Friday night in March 10 years ago 191 men, women and children were drowned when the roll-on-roll-off ferry Herald of Free Enterprise capsized as it left the Belgian port of Zeebrugge on the way to Dover. "The memory is still clear," Harbour Master Ignace Vergult, who was not on duty on the night of March 6, 1987 but who was called in, told Reuters by telephone. "We hope that it will never, ever, happen again. Ferry safety has improved since then, but whether it has improved enough is another question," he said. Survivors and the relatives of the dead will hold memorial services in Dover and Zeebrugge on Sunday, after which the British Herald Families Association will be quietly be wound up. "The pain has been too much. They feel they have done all they can," Mark Watts, British Labour Member of the European Parliament for East Kent, told Reuters in an interview. "As politicians we have a responsibility to maintain the momentum," he said. Watts agrees with Vergult that passenger ferry safety has improved a bit since the Herald went down. But he argues strongly that there is far, far more still to be done. "If an aircraft had a design fault the fleet would be grounded. But ferries are allowed to sail with fundamental design flaws," he said. The Herald rolled over and sank in shallow water because it had become unstable due to taking on water through leaving port with the bow doors open. Immediately after a number of changes were made to enhance ferry safety. Notable among these were the installation of inner doors to supplement the main outer doors, and a signalling system to prevent the ferry leaving dock with the outer doors open. But ferry companies resisted other recommendations such as installing water-tight bulkheads on car decks and making a full passenger list -- moves they still argue against. The business of finding and identifying the dead from the Herald was made considerably harder by the fact that no one knew how many people were on board. It was not until the ferry Estonia sank during a storm in the Baltic, killing most of the 867 passengers and crew in September 1994 that the issue gained new momentum. "Nothing really happened after the Herald sank. A few minor technical changes were made but nothing that addressed the fundamental issues," Watts said. "It was not until the Estonia went down that things started to happen again. "Since the Estonia sank we have had the Stockholm agreement on maritime safety, but even that does not go far enough because it does not insist on the fundamental design changes that were proposed after the Herald sank," he added. Watts said one of the main problems was the reluctance of the ferry operators -- particularly those on the cross-channel run where they are facing tough competition from each other and the Channel Tunnel -- to incur extra costs. There was also, he said, the problem that there is no single organisation either competent or capable of policing the seas. "There are a whole myriad of organisations apparently enforcing the law. We feel there should be one single body," Watts said, adding that although the International Maritime Organisation did have powers it could only act by unanimity. "People's lives are being put at risk. Is it going to take another Herald or Estonia before we take the whole issue seriously?" he said.
83167>>0>> General Motors said on Thursday that Volkswagen's aggressive policies had prompted a price war in Europe's car market which has led some manufacturers to fire workers and look closely at future production plans. General Motors Europe President Richard Donnelly also said in an interview that Korean and Japanese sales posed a threat in Europe. Korea should open its markets to international competition. This would take the steam out of suspicions that Korean trading practices were unfair, Donnelly said. He said Germany's VW, the market leader in Europe, had sharpened up its management but also taken action tantamount to buying sales. "I think VW has done a couple of things. They are managing their total portfolio pretty well of SEAT, Skoda, VW and Audi," Donnelly said on the Opel stand at the Geneva car show. The VW group operates these four marques. "VW also seems to be very, very aggressive on price and for whatever reason I don't know but, you can buy (market) share at a price, and they have been extremely aggressive on price, so I think these two things are why they have been gaining some share," Donnelly said. A VW spokesman was not available for comment. GM Europe sells Opels and Vauxhalls and has a half share and management control of Swedish niche producer Saab. Donnelly said Opel and Vauxhall had been drawn in to the sales/price dogfight to a degree, but not as much as VW. VW raised its market share in Europe last year to 17.2 percent from 16.8 percent. Opel/Vauxhall was second with 12.5 percent, Peugeot Citroen of France was next with 11.9 percent, followed by Ford (11.6 percent) and Fiat of Italy (11.2). France's Renault had 10.1 percent. Analysts have been applauding VW's revitalisation. "VW has been a tottering giant, massive and slow to respond, but look at them now. They've broken with tradition and suddenly developed teeth and are prepared to use them, and did they use them. 1996 was VW's year," said Peter Schmidt of Britain's Automotive Industry Data. Schmidt, joint managing director at A.I.D., said VW had stolen a march on the competition with price cuts and marketing spending. Consumers, once won over, are reluctant to swap brands. "This is all gloomy news for Peugeot and Renault. I feel they've made a fundamental blunder in not taking part in this marketing war. GM too. They are not competing aggressively enough, and that applies to Ford and Fiat as well," Schmidt said. But Donnelly said over-aggressive actions, particularly from companies that are weak financially, made little sense. "We are willing to give up a little share frankly if we can run profitably. If you look at some of the companies that are dropping price they are already in a loss position which seems strange," Donnelly said. These price wars have devastated some profit margins, although VW has improved its financial position, and GM has retained its lead as the most profitable European car company, according to London's Economist Intelligence Unit. "We never predict profits, but I'll tell you this. I think for all the manufacturers it's going to be a difficult year. I think aggressive pricing has reduced margins, so we are all going to have to scramble," Donnelly said.
83167>>0>> Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Friday. LONDON - Shares pushed further into record territory, closing higher for the fourth consecutive session and for the 13th time this year as Wall Street continued to defy gravity. The FTSE 100 closed 21.0 points higher at 4,420.3. The index jumped 112 points during the week and has risen by 302 points so far this year. FRANKFURT - The IBIS DAX index put a brief round of profit-taking behind it and headed into the weekend back in bullish mood after higher than expected U.S. jobless data gave the stock market a lift. The IBIS DAX-30 index ended the day at 3,419.51 points. Earlier the DAX index, which tracks bourse trade in 30 German blue-chips, finished down 41.40 points at 3,376.20 but showing a rise of 116.56 over the week. PARIS - Stocks shrugged off news of stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs growth to set a third consecutive closing record.

83167>>0>> Pakistani stocks eased on Friday mainly on a technical correction ahead of the Saturday-Sunday weekend as investors kept to the sidelines because of political and economic uncertainty, dealers said. "On the political front, the PML (Pakistan Muslim League) has yet to settle some differences with its allies, specially in the Sindh province," dealer Zubair Ilahi said adding that country's economic outlook also appears grim. The index fell 7.80 points, or 0.49 percent, to 1,580.25 an hour before the end. Losers led gainers 213 to 48. Dewan Salman Fibre fell 0.10 rupees to 40.70. -- Amir Zia 9221-5685192
83167>>0>> The leader of Volkswagen AG's supervisory board said on Monday that he expected no personnel changes on the German carmaker's supervisory board at least through the summer. VW supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen, responding to German media speculation about a pending shakeup on the VW board, said board members would be up for re-election in June but that three would not run again because of their age. The carmaker's regulations require supervisory board members to step down when they reach age 70. VW's annual report shows that supervisory board members Carl Hahn, Walter Keisler Kiep and Otto Graf Lambsdorf would be required to step down because of their age. A VW spokesman declined to confirm which members may step down from the VW board. German media reports have speculated that VW may shake up its supervisory board amid allegations of some VW workers demanding and receiving bribes in return for contracts. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Lebanon and Australia signed an agreement on Tuesday to develop bilateral economic, trade and technical ties, the Lebanese government said. It said in a statement the two countries agreed under the pact signed in Beirut by Economy Minister Yassin Jaber and Australian Trade Minister Timothy Fischer, to do their best to develop trade, economic and technical cooperation. "Both Contracting Parties agree to encourage where appropriate economic, trading and technical cooperation between natural and juridical persons of their respective countries, including the setting up of joint projects and joint companies in various fields," the agreement said. The agreement said the two sides shall accord each other unconditional most-favoured-nation treatment in all matters with respect to customs duties and import/export charges. They also agreed to establish a joint committee on trade, economic and technical cooperation from both sides to secure the effective implementation of the agreement. The agreement remains in effect for one year and shall be automatically extended year by year unless one of the two countries notifies the other in writing of its intention to terminate it.
83167>>0>> The outgoing vice-chairman of Czech Skoda Auto a.s., a unit of Volkswagen AG , rejected as "nonsense" on Wednesday a German magazine report connecting him to a VW bribery affair under investigation. Volkhard Koehler was unexpectedly replaced on Skoda's board last week, and a subsequent story in the weekly Der Spiegel said it was because he had prevented an investigation into a bribery affair linked to VW employees and was involved in dubious real estate transactions. A Skoda spokesman, Milan Smutny, said in a statement on Wednesday that Koehler had spoken to economic corruption investigators in the German city of Braunschweig who confirmed that he was not the subject of any investigation. "The state prosecution office confirmed that (Koehler) is not the target of any investigation," Smutny said. He quoted Koehler as saying Der Spiegel's claims were "absolutely nonsense". VW chairman Ferdinand Piech said last week that corruption allegations, which centred on a plant expansion contract for Skoda awarded to Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB , involved "a nearly double-digit sum in the millions of marks". He said a probe into allegations that VW employees have demanded and received bribes in return for contracts, had so far turned up only one employee who has since been suspended. The employee was not named. Piech said the figures involved are well below German media reports that have said the contract was worth some 400 million marks and included bribes of about 20 million marks. VW said its purchasing division in the summer of 1994 approved a 74 million mark contract for a Skoda paint factory and a second contract worth 38 million marks to expand the facility. Smutny said that all decisions on purchases over 100,000 marks at Skoda had to be approved by officials at Volkswagen headquarters in Germany. German prosecutors in Braunschweig have said they were investigating two suspects as part of their probe at VW, brought about by the carmaker in a formal legal request. Smutny said Koehler was expecting another assignment from VW headquarters in Wolfsburg after his stint with Skoda ends on April 15. He said that the non-renewal of his contract conformed to standard Volkswagen practice. The functions of Skoda board members named last week will be announced in a news conference on April 3, Smutny said.
83167>>0>> Former Volkswagen AG executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua said industrial espionage charges against him are a "manipulated controversy," according to an interview in Friday's USA Today. The newspaper, which spoke to Lopez after a conference in Amsterdam, said he sounded confident about his ability to overcome his legal problems and about his new management consulting firm, Lopez de Arriortua & Co. "This is all ... manipulated controversy, artificial controversy," Lopez was quoted as saying. "We have no fear. We have more clients than we can use." German prosecutors in December charged Lopez and three VW associates with stealing trade secrets from General Motors Corp. when they left the Detroit-based automaker to join VW in March 1993. Lopez, credited with cutting purchasing costs at both automakers, resigned from VW in November. The Justice Department is continuing an investigation that could result in criminal charges against Lopez and his associates. GM dropped a civil racketeering suit against Lopez as part of a $1.1 billion settlement that also called for VW to sever ties with Lopez. Asked if the turmoil has ruined his reputation, Lopez compared himself to General Electric Co. Chairman Jack Welch, who overcame a reputation for ruthless cost cutting to become one of the world's most respected corporate executives. "Jack Welch is doing an excellent job today. But some days, he was in the press very often, and nasty things were said about him," Lopez said. "But he had a clear vision. He said to the people, 'Don't look back, don't look at politics, make your company without boundaries.' Now he demonstrates that he was all right." Consultants can't "be in the position of Jack Welch. But I will try to do my best," Lopez told the newspaper. Lopez de Arriortua & Co. already has conducted a dozen turnaround seminars for clients in Europe, and Lopez said U.S. companies have shown interest. But the newspaper said he smiled and shrugged when asked if he would travel to the United States to conduct a seminar. He has not set foot on U.S. soil since he left GM four years ago.

83167>>0>> Pakistani stocks, hit by country's economic troubles, sagged at Monday's close on blue chip selling, but dealers said a small technical rally was now due. "Genuine investors are on the sidelines because economic indicators predict a testing time for the Pakistan economy," dealer Mohammad Iqbal said. "We see a stagnant market in coming weeks as there is not much place for a downside either." "Those blue chips fell today that had risen during the last two sessions. But a small technical rally is now due," he said. The Karachi 100-share index fell 15.18 points, or 0.95 percent, to end at 1,575.65.

83167>>0>> The financial services unit of German carmaker Volkswagen AG said on Wednesday its 1996 net income rose 60 percent to 266 million marks on the back of a 12 percent surge in the number of new financing agreements. The VW unit said it transferred 55.4 million marks of the profit to Volkswagen, which is the unit's sole shareholder. VW said the financial services unit entered into nearly 840,000 financing and leasing agreements in 1996 compared with 750,000 in 1995 and accounted for nearly every third vehicle sold by the Volkswagen group in western Europe last year. VW's German financial services unit again posted the highest business volumes in 1996 and accounted for 72 percent of all existing finance and lease contracts and 578,000 of the new contracts signed. At the end of 1996, VW said its customer finance lending portfolio held by the unit had grown by 11 percent to a new record level of 1.2 million agreements in Europe. Volkswagen said it expected the unit "to again record good results" for 1997 based on what it said were positive economic forecasts reported for almost all of the countries where the financial services unit operates. The VW unit's management board chairman, Norbert Massfeller, said VW would keep up its international expansion in new European markets and also in Asia. VW in January started a new leasing company in Poland in January and plans for a new bank in the country. In addition, VW said the financial services unit would offer a nominal 20 billion yen Samurai bond at the end of March through its Dutch subsidiary. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG reaffirmed its ambitious rebuilding programme Friday when the supervisory board renewed Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech's contract for five VW's supervisory board had long been expected to give Piech, 59, another term starting in January 1998 after voicing their support when he was under fire by General Motors Corp. for allegations of industrial spying when he hired away Jose Ignacio Lopez. The board's endorsement of Piech was viewed by industry analysts as giving him further power to keep up the rebuilding of Volkswagen that he started in 1993 when he brought on board purchasing guru Jose Ignacio Lopez to revamp VW's operations. "It was important that Piech stay on after the troubles with General Motors were finished," said Sabine Bluemel, analyst at IGI Sigeco in London. "He is the driver behind the restructuring," Bluemel said. Lopez resigned last November, about a month before VW reached a settlement over GM's allegations that he stole secret GM documents when he led a group of executives who defected to VW in March 1993. The settlement, which called for VW to pay GM $100 million and buy $1 billion worth of parts, ended a U.S. civil lawsuit in which Piech was named as a defendant, prompting speculation that he would be forced off the Volkswagen board. But VW Friday reaffirmed that Piech, the grandson of VW founder Ferdinand Porsche, was fully in charge at the carmaker and would keep up the restructuring programme that he started in 1993. One sign of his control was the announcement that management board member Martin Posth would leave VW, ending 25 years with the carmaker. Board member Robert Buechelhofer will take over Posth's responsibilities for the Asia-Pacific region. Volkswagen said Posth, a board member for nine years, was leaving the company "by mutual agreement."

One sign of his control was the announcement that management board member Martin Posth would leave VW, ending 25 years with the carmaker. Board member Robert Buechelhofer will take over Posth's responsibilities for the Asia-Pacific region. Volkswagen said Posth, a board member for nine years, was leaving the company "by mutual agreement." Sources in the German car industry have frequently spoken of clashes between Posth and Piech over the past few years and he becomes one of the last board members that Piech inherited to leave the group. Also on Friday, VW said the supervisory board gave formal approval to its 1996 results that showed a 77 percent rise in group income from ordinary activities to 1.97 billion marks and a net profit of 678 million marks. VW's board approved an employee share purchase programme that will call for the Wolfsburg-based carmaker to raise its base capital by 135 million marks in a bid to allow its 265,000 employees to participate in the carmaker's profits. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

83167>>0>> The former Volkswagen AG executive at the centre of a four-year industrial spying battle between VW and General Motors Corp. described his work at VW as an "extremely great success" and said he would write a book one day about how he left the automaker. In an interview with German daily Bild-Zeitung published Thursday, Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, who has been charged in Germany with betraying corporate secrets, said he helped VW to become the "Number One in Europe, in Brazil, in China, in Mexico." Lopez, a renowned cost-cutter whose move from General Motors to VW sparked a four-year legal battle, quit VW last November following a series of adverse court rulings. He has since set up his own consulting firm, Lopez de Arriortua & Co, and has already conducted a dozen seminars for clients in Europe. Referring to his time at VW, Lopez said, "I was able to work with many good people, also with geniuses like (Management Board Chairman) Dr. (Ferdinand) Piech. Together we managed the turnaround at VW." Lopez's departure from VW, where his cost-cutting helped return the carmaker to profitability, paved the way for an out-of-court settlement in which VW agreed to pay GM $100 million in compensation and buy $1 billion worth of GM parts in return for GM dropping a civil racketeering suit in the U.S. GM alleged that Lopez and other former GM managers stole secrets about research, planning and purchasing for new factories as well as GM cars under development when they defected to VW in 1993. VW and Lopez consistently denied the charges. Interviewed in Bilbao in his home Basque region, Lopez said his new company offered prospective clients advice on how to cut costs by 50 percent in three years. Asked whether he was glad to have retired from day-to-day work as VW production chief, Lopez said: "Do you know the story of the gazelle and the lion? Both wake up in the jungle and realise they must go on to survive; the gazelle to flee the lion, the lion to catch the gazelle. "It does not matter if you're a gazelle or a lion. As soon as the sun rises you must move -- otherwise things look bad for you." German prosecutors in December filed charges against Lopez and three other former GM employees, Jose Manuel Gutierrez, Rosario Piazza and Jorge Alvarez, who followed Lopez to VW in March 1993. They are accused of taking more than 20,000 documents and computer discs with millions of pages of secret GM data with them when they joined VW. If convicted, they could face up to five years in prison or a fine. But legal experts say first-time offenders do not usually face prison. The charges must now be reviewed by a court, which will determine whether the evidence supports the allegations. Prosecutors declined to predict when a trial could begin.

83167>>0>> Dow Chemical Co. said Tuesday it filed a lawsuit charging General Electric Co. with pirating trade secrets from Dow's automotive and engineering plastics businesses. Dow said its complaint, filed in Oakland County Circuit Court in Michigan, alleges that GE systematically and aggressively targeted, recruited and hired Dow employees who were privy to Dow trade secrets. Dow said GE put these employees into similar jobs where they would inevitably use confidential information on Dow's advances in automotive plastics technology. The suit seeks unspecified monetary damages in excess of $10,000 and an injunction that would halt those GE hiring practices and require that GE put the former Dow employees in jobs that will not require or inevitably cause them to use trade secrets. "We're filing this suit because we believe that GE is breaking the law," Dow automotive president Larry Denton said in a statement. "GE was unable to duplicate our advances in automotive technology so they set out to raid our workforce in order to loot our trade secrets." Dow and GE are rivals in the growing market for high-tech plastics that allow automakers to reduce vehicle weight and cost and improve styling and performance. GE spokesman Bruce Bunch said the industrial giant vigorously denied the allegations and would fight the lawsuit. "GE respects the value and importance of trade secrets. We have reviewed Dow's allegations and find them to be groundless and without merit," Bunch said. "GE has not obtained any Dow Chemical trade secrets." Bunch added that GE has guidelines in place that prevent it from using confidential information from a new employee's former employer. Earlier this year General Motors Corp. reached a $1.1 billion settlement with Volkswagen AG that ended a long-running dispute over GM's allegations that Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and his followers stole GM trade secrets when they abruptly left GM to join VW in 1993. Lopez resigned as VW's production chief in November 1996 and is facing criminal charges in Germany. In a civil racketeering lawsuit that was settled in the deal, GM had alleged that Lopez, who was head of worldwide purchase at GM, stole confidential information on GM's future product plans, supplier prices and manufacturing techniques, which it claimed contributed to VW's recent financial turnaround.
83167>>0>> In another high-profile industrial espionage case, Dow Chemical Co. Tuesday filed a lawsuit charging General Electric Co. with pirating trade secrets from Dow's automotive plastics business. Dow's complaint, filed in Oakland County Circuit Court in Pontiac, Mich., alleged that GE systematically and aggressively targeted, recruited and hired 14 Dow employees who were privy to Dow trade secrets. Dow said GE put the employees into jobs where they would inevitably use confidential information on Dow's advances in automotive plastics technology. The suit seeks substantial unspecified monetary damages and a permanent injunction that would, among other things, prevent GE from any activity that using Dow's information. Oakland County Circuit Judge Edward Sosnick issued a temporary restraining order to that effect against GE shortly after the suit was filed. The order, which needs confirmation at an April 9 hearing, prohibits GE from recruiting new Dow employees and from destroying any records about the 14 ex-Dow employees. It also requires GE to return any Dow documents the employees brought to GE and to give Darin Evans -- the only ex-Dow employee named as a defendant in the suit -- a new job where he would not be in a position to use any Dow secrets. At the heart of the suit is Dow's expertise in designing and integrating complex plastic components such as car and truck instrument panels. It maintains its superior technological know-how earned it lucrative contracts to provide the plastics used in the instrument panels for Chrysler Corp.'s new Dodge Dakota pickup truck and Jeep Cherokee sport utility vehicle. "We're filing this suit because we believe that GE is breaking the law," said Dow automotive president Larry Denton. "GE was unable to duplicate our advances in automotive technology so they set out to raid our workforce in order to loot our trade secrets." Dow and GE are bitter rivals in the growing market for high-tech plastics that allow automakers to reduce vehicle weight and cost and improve styling and performance. GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., said it would comply with the restraining order, but will vigorously fight the lawsuit. "GE respects the value and importance of trade secrets. We have reviewed Dow's allegations and find them to be groundless and without merit," GE spokesman Bruce Bunch said. "GE has not obtained any Dow Chemical trade secrets." Bunch added that Evans, the defendant, was in a non-supervisory engineering job and only has about five years of experience. The dispute comes about three months after General Motors Corp. reached a $1.1 billion settlement with Volkswagen AG that ended a long-running dispute over GM's allegations that Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and his followers stole GM trade secrets when they abruptly left GM to join VW in 1993. Lopez, who had served as GM's purchasing chief, resigned as VW's production chief in November 1996 and is facing criminal charges in Germany. In a link between the two cases, Dow has hired Eugene Driker, one of the main lawyers GM used in its now-settled civil racketeering lawsuit against VW. Driker said Tuesday that Dow will seek substantial damages from GE in a jury trial because the trade secrets could allow GE to quickly catch up to Dow's level of expertise with far less expense. "It's very hard to assess the valuation of a secret that's disclosed to a competitor where that competitor can avoid going down blind alleys, avoiding mistakes that you've made and go for the gold based upon your own trade secret," he said. Dow is not seeking a criminal probe of GE's actions, Driker said. Dow gave GE nearly a month to rectify the situation before the civil suit was filed, but he said GE took no corrective actions.

Dow said GE put the employees into jobs where they would inevitably use confidential information on Dow's advances in automotive plastics technology. The suit seeks substantial unspecified monetary damages and a permanent injunction that would, among other things, prevent GE from any activity that using Dow's information. Oakland County Circuit Judge Edward Sosnick issued a temporary restraining order to that effect against GE shortly after the suit was filed. The order, which needs confirmation at an April 9 hearing, prohibits GE from recruiting new Dow employees and from destroying any records about the 14 ex-Dow employees. It also requires GE to return any Dow documents the employees brought to GE and to give Darin Evans -- the only ex-Dow employee named as a defendant in the suit -- a new job where he would not be in a position to use any Dow secrets. At the heart of the suit is Dow's expertise in designing and integrating complex plastic components such as car and truck instrument panels. It maintains its superior technological know-how earned it lucrative contracts to provide the plastics used in the instrument panels for Chrysler Corp.'s new Dodge Dakota pickup truck and Jeep Cherokee sport utility vehicle. "We're filing this suit because we believe that GE is breaking the law," said Dow automotive president Larry Denton. "GE was unable to duplicate our advances in automotive technology so they set out to raid our workforce in order to loot our trade secrets." Dow and GE are bitter rivals in the growing market for high-tech plastics that allow automakers to reduce vehicle weight and cost and improve styling and performance. GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., said it would comply with the restraining order, but will vigorously fight the lawsuit. "GE respects the value and importance of trade secrets. We have reviewed Dow's allegations and find them to be groundless and without merit," GE spokesman Bruce Bunch said. "GE has not obtained any Dow Chemical trade secrets." Bunch added that Evans, the defendant, was in a non-supervisory engineering job and only has about five years of experience. The dispute comes about three months after General Motors Corp. reached a $1.1 billion settlement with Volkswagen AG that ended a long-running dispute over GM's allegations that Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and his followers stole GM trade secrets when they abruptly left GM to join VW in 1993. Lopez, who had served as GM's purchasing chief, resigned as VW's production chief in November 1996 and is facing criminal charges in Germany. In a link between the two cases, Dow has hired Eugene Driker, one of the main lawyers GM used in its now-settled civil racketeering lawsuit against VW. Driker said Tuesday that Dow will seek substantial damages from GE in a jury trial because the trade secrets could allow GE to quickly catch up to Dow's level of expertise with far less expense. "It's very hard to assess the valuation of a secret that's disclosed to a competitor where that competitor can avoid going down blind alleys, avoiding mistakes that you've made and go for the gold based upon your own trade secret," he said. Dow is not seeking a criminal probe of GE's actions, Driker said. Dow gave GE nearly a month to rectify the situation before the civil suit was filed, but he said GE took no corrective actions.
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG, starting off 1997 predicting better first quarter results due to a 9.5 percent rise in sales, said on Thursday it expected higher profits and sales for the year. The company's 1996 results got a hefty lift from the German mark's decline in currency markets. VW said in its 1996 annual report issued on Thursday that it expected "postive results" for 1997 despite forecasts for slow consumer spending as many European nations slash spending to qualify for European currency union set to begin in 1999. "We expect our 1997 earnings to be slightly better than last year," VW chief financial officer Bruno Adelt said at the carmaker's news conference, toning down his comment in a speech text in which he predicted "overproportional" profit growth. But VW said on Thursday its 1996 results were hurt by a 1.5 billion mark ($870 million) charge to reduce the interest rate growth forecast for its pension funds to five percent from six percent. If VW had not opted for the pension fund change, VW officials said the results would have been sharply above the doubling in 1996 group profit of 678 million marks. VW shares surged on the strong outlook, rising four percent to above 1,000 marks for the first time in VW history. VW did not release quarterly results but VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech said the data were above the 1996 first quarter despite the Wolfsburg-based carmaker losing 64 million marks from lost production of about 10,000 vehicles in a strike by Spanish truckers in February that cut off parts shipments. "We do not make our quarterly results public but I can say that our results were better than last year," Piech said. VW said on Thursday sales for the first three months of 1997 rose 9.5 percent to 1.033 million vehicles from 943 million vehicles in the 1995 first quarter, spurred by double-digit growth in many foreign markets, particularly Asia. But VW said its German sales slumped 4.9 percent to 234,000 units during the three-month period, in part hurt by lost output for its popular Polo model due to the Spanish strike. The carmaker said it expected the German economy to show limited growth and little improvement in the jobless crisis that may curb car sales. But slower sales growth in Germany and also western Europe should be compensated for by growth in Asia and Latin America as VW steps up its foreign expansion. VW management board member Robert Buechelhofer said the weaker first quarter German sales could be made up and said VW should show sales growth in its domestic market for 1997 and also defend its leading European market share of 17.2 percent. VW's forecasts come after it earlier this year reported a near doubling in 1996 group profit to 678 million marks from 336 million marks behind a 10.6 percent growth in sales to 3.977 billion marks and a 10 percent growth in group vehicle sales to nearly four million units. The carmaker said its 1996 results were aided by about 600 million marks in gains from currency market turbulence and the weakening of the mark against the dollar, lira and pound in late 1996 that reduced the cost of vehicles sold abroad. Despite overall lacklustre industry conditions, VW said it had seen unexpectedly strong demand for its new Passat saloon and would increase 1997 production by up to 25 percent. Piech said VW would boost Passat output by up to 100,000 units from the planned 300,000, in part due to demand for a new estate wagon version recently unveiled at the Geneva car show. The strong demand for the Passat, at the top end of the VW brand product range, comes as VW said on Thursday it would expand its product line to about 50 models in the next three years from the current level of 38 models. "The expansion of our product line is going to accelerate in the coming years," Piech said. Piech defended VW's future goal of using only four vehicle platform structures to build cars under the VW, Skoda, Seat and Audi brands, dismissing criticism by some industry observers that there was not enough differentiation between the brands. "We remain convinced that the platform strategy that we have developed is still the best way for us to remain competitive," Piech said. The carmaker currently used 19 different platforms within the VW group. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525 ($ = 1.722 German Marks)
83167>>0>> German carmaker Volkswagen AG said on Thursday it had seen unexpectedly strong demand for its new Passat vehicle and would increase the 1997 production schedule by up to 25 percent. VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech told journalists at a company event late on Wednesday that VW would likely boost Passat production by up to 100,000 units from the planned 300,000, in part due to demand for a new estate wagon version. The strong demand for the Passat, the top end of VW's product line, was announced as VW said on Thursday it would expand its product range to about 50 models in the next three years from the current level of 38 models. The carmaker said it would introduce a so-called "three-litre" auto, one that could travel about 100 kilometers on less than three liters of gasoline, by the turn of the century. "The expansion of our product line is going to accelerate in the coming years," Piech said in the text of a speech released before VW's annual news conference on Thursday. Piech defended VW's future goal of using only four vehicle platforms to build cars under the VW, Skoda, Seat and Audi brands, dismissing criticism by some industry observers that there was not enough differentiation between the brands. The plan calls for VW group brands to use common platforms to build cars. For example, the Audi A4 and VW Passat are built on the same platform as will be the new VW Golf and the existing Audi A3 compact model. Some industry observers have said cars so far produced on common platforms have been too similar and may "cannibalise" sales within the VW group, a view generally rejected by Piech. "We remain convinced that the platform strategy that we have developed is still the best way for us to remain competitive," Piech said, noting the carmaker currently used about 20 different platforms. Piech, however, did concede that the introduction of the new Passat reduced demand last year for the Audi A4 model more than the carmaker had expected but still led to growth in demand for the two vehicles combined over 1995 levels. VW has long said the platform strategy would reduce product development times, allow VW to offer more products and simplify production. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG said on Thursday its Volkswagen and Audi AG brands, along with its Volkswagen financial services unit, were the top contributors to its 1996 group net profit of 678 million marks. Volkswagen chief executive Ferdinand Piech said in the text of a speech at the German carmaker's annual news conference that growth in volume sales was a major factor for the higher profits, which were backed by a 10.7 percent increase in group vehicle deliveries to 3.994 million units last year. The German carmaker earlier this year said its group profit nearly doubled to 678 million marks from 336 million marks in 1995 behind a 10.6 percent growth in group sales to 3.977 billion marks. Piech also said VW's troubled Seat Spanish subsidiary reported a profit in 1996 for the first time since 1993, in part due to what he called "special factors". "Further efforts are required to keep Seat in the profit zone," Piech said. VW's Skoda Czech unit also reported positive results for last year, Piech said. In addition, Piech said VW has decided its Europcar vehicle rental unit was "no longer a burden" for VW after "considerable discussions" last year about whether to sell the troubled unit in which it has a 50 percent stake. VW said in its annual report that Europcar reduced its losses in 1996 to about one million marks from 40 million marks in 1996 through changes in fleet management, cost-saving measures and higher sales in Spain, France and Portugual. "A return to profits is expected for 1997," VW said of the Europcar unit in the annual report. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> VA Technologie AG, whose unit VAI is enmeshed in an industrial espionage row with Scandinavian rival Kvaerner, on Wednesday maintained its assertion it had committed no wrongdoing. "We don't need to spy. We are the leader in technology," said VA Tech chief executive Othmar Puehringer. Davy International, Kvaerner's UK metals processing arm, alleges employees who formerly worked at a Davy subsidiary in Britain took key documents with them when recruited by VAI. Davy pressed charges after VAI won a lucrative order last year from the Saudi Iron and Steel company (Hadeed) for which both companies had been bitterly competing. "Several employees took documents with them. That was wrong. But VAI did not use these documents," Puehringer said, adding the technology applied at the Hadeed plant was of a totally different nature from the one offered by Davy. Puehringer said it was as yet unclear in which country the court case would take place. -- Vienna newsroom, +431 531 12256
83167>>0>> An International Monetary Fund mission began meetings with top ministers in Kiev on Monday to review progress on the long-delayed budget, which would pave the way for receipt of a multi-billion dollar IMF credit. The international funding body is waiting to issue a three-year, $2.5 to $3 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) credit on condition that the former Soviet republic of 51 million people passes the tough budget and a series of tax reform laws to underpin it. "The main goal of the meetings is to review and agree upon conditions which will be included in the memorandum to grant Ukraine a credit for structural reform," an Economy Ministry statement said. IMF officials were not available for comment, but the statement added that Economy Minister Yuri Yekhanurov met an IMF technical group last week. "Questions were discussed about the general situation which has emerged in Ukraine regarding implementation of macro-economic reforms, and how well Ukraine was fulfilling previously agreed conditions which must be put into effect before the credit can be received," the statement said. Both the budget and proposed laws have been caught between the government and a largely conservative parliament reluctant to implement further tough measures in President Leonid Kuchma's economic reform programme launched in late 1994. Ukraine's economy has shrunk every year since independence six years ago, with a drop in gross domestic product of 10 percent in 1996. Foreign investment has been low, the shadow economy has grown, and a $3.1 billion wage debt owed to workers is expanding. The budget, which was due January 1, led a top economic adviser to say at the weekend Ukraine could lose the confidence of Western funding bodies and investors and even risked economic collapse. "I hope that the president, parliament and government could agree to work every day around the clock to fix this crisis," Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Harvard Institute for International Development, told a news conference. --Irene Marushko, Kiev Newsroom +380 44 244 9150
83167>>0>> A U.S. Justice Department report released on Monday sharply criticised the FBI for failing to pursue leads that likely would have led to the earlier uncovering of CIA officer Aldrich Ames as a spy for Moscow. The report said proper attention by top FBI management to the intelligence losses suffered by the United States in the mid-1980s and better communication within the FBI "would have likely led to an earlier discovery of Ames, thus cutting short his career of espionage." Ames, a former CIA officer, was arrested in February 1994. He later pleaded guilty to spying for Moscow since 1985 in what federal prosecutors have called one of the worst and most damaging espionage cases in U.S. history. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Bromwich recently completed a 400-page, top-secret report on the FBI's handling of the Ames case. A 15-page, unclassified summary was released on Monday. "Our review revealed that throughout nearly the entire nine-year period of Ames' espionage, FBI management devoted inadequate attention to determining the cause of the sudden, unprecedented and catastrophic losses suffered by both the FBI and the CIA in their Soviet intelligence programmes," he said. Ames passed information to the KGB that led to the compromise and execution of at least 10 people who acted as spies for the FBI and CIA. The losses of the spies started in 1985-86. "If the FBI and the CIA had initiated a joint investigation of these losses in 1987 or 1988, there is reason to believe that Ames would have emerged as a mole suspect," Bromwich said. "FBI's senior management was almost entirely unaware of the scope and significance of the mid-1980s losses and of the FBI's limited efforts to determine their cause," he said. Bromwich said the FBI never showed any sustained interest before 1991 to investigating the CIA's losses, and a joint CIA-FBI effort starting in mid-1991 suffered from "inadequate management attention as well as insufficient resources." Once espionage emerged as the leading theory for explaining the losses of the U.S. spies, the FBI should have aggressively investigated, he said, adding: "Here, the FBI ignorned the obvious disaster at the CIA." In August 1992, a CIA-FBI team had collected compelling circumstantial evidence implicating Ames, but failed to recommend that the FBI open a criminal investigation," he said. The FBI waited until after the team's final report had been issued in March 1993 before opening the investigation, Bromwich said. As part of the review, Bromwich's team interviewed Ames, who is serving a sentence of life in prison, reviewed more than 26,000 pages of documents and conducted more than 100 interviews. The FBI said in a statement it has "strongly taken issue with many aspects of the report." The FBI admitted strained ties with the CIA in the 1980s, but said changes in 1993 fixed the problem, with the relationship now "at its historic best."

83167>>0>> Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Wednesday. LONDON - UK shares rose to five-week highs, lifted Tuesday's buoyant Wall Street, where hopes for continued strong profit growth helped spark the biggest one-day Dow rise in point terms for ten years. Shrugging off the Bank of England's latest call for higher interest rates, the FTSE 100 index closed up 41.6 points at 4,387.7. FRANKFURT - Germany's DAX share index shrugged off weakness in one of its heavyweight shares to post solid gains in bourse trade, drawing strength from overnight Wall Street gains and the firmer dollar. The 30-share DAX index ended up 55.62 points at 3,395.95. In post-bourese trade the DAX was up 17.97 at 3366.87. PARIS - French shares finished higher but off their session highs due to a softer dollar tone and weakness in morning trading on Wall Street. Profit-taking on the last day of the April account also meant the CAC index failed to break through resistance at 2,550. The CAC had rebounded sharply at the opening, helped by the Dow's sharp rise on Tuesday and a generally strong dollar. The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 18.97 points at 2,533.64. ZURICH - Swiss shares closed firmer but the blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) backed off an all-time high of 4813.7 points after Wall Street opened weak. Wall Street's second-biggest point jump in history on Tuesday, the firmer dollar, the stronger bond market and options related buying supported the market. The broad Swiss Performance Index advanced 16.39 points, at 3,022.83 points. TOKYO - Tokyo stocks closed sharply higher after waves of buying of blue-chip shares cancelled out losses caused by profit-taking in sectors such as banks, which had been propped up by short-covering in recent sessions. The Nikkei average finished at 18,735.47 after gaining 191.02 points, its highest close since Febraury 27, when it ended at 19,021. HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks closed sharply higher on Wednesday, but came off the morning's peaks due to caution regarding the longer term outlook for U.S. and Hong Kong interest rates. The Hang Seng Index closed 126.19 points higher at 12,707.04, after shooting to a day's high of 12,758.28 at the start of trading. SYDNEY - A buoyant Australian share market locked in solid gains by the close on Wednesday after Wall Street surged and local markets comfortably digested March quarter inflation figures. The All Ordinaries index climbed 24.7 points to 2,472.3. JOHANNESBURG - South African industrial shares finished slightly firmer, but came off their morning highs on profit-taking in late trade on Wednesday, dealers said. Wall Street's rise by 173 points on Tuesday had propelled the industrials higher in early trade with some dealers welcoming the bouyancy while others predicted a breather towards close of trade. The dealers said underlying sentiment remained positive but most market players were cautious ahead of economic data -- money supply, private sector credit growth extension and trade figures -- due out on Thursday and Friday. The industrial index closed 40.3 points up at 8,414.8, and the all-share index added 14.3 points to 7,080.2. The gold index closed down 31.6 points at 1,231.8.
83167>>0>> An Israeli textile worker is to stand trial in Cairo on Thursday on charges of spying for the Jewish state and damaging Egypt's national interests. The trial of Azam Azam, a 35-year-old chief mechanic at an Israeli-owned factory in Egypt, comes during one of the lowest ebbs in Egyptian-Israeli relations since the two countries signed a peace accord in 1979. Azam is to stand trial at the South Cairo Supreme State Security Court where prosecutors are expected to ask for the harshest possible sentence, which would be life imprisonment with hard labour. "I expect the trial to add some strain to relations between the two governments but it will put greater strain on already overheated public opinion," said Saad Eddin Ibrahim, president of the Ibn Khaldoun Centre for Development Studies. "Public opinion in Egypt is already charged against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel. The anti-peace groups will use the case to renew their arguments that Israel can't be trusted and that it continues to undermine Egypt's security," he told Reuters. Israel has said Azam, who was arrested in Cairo in November, was not working for any of its intelligence organisations and appealed for his release. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak told a joint news conference with Netanyahu in Cairo in March he could not interfere with the judicial system. Mubarak chided Israel for publicising the case, saying it had damaged Azam's chances and he compared it to an earlier incident in which Egyptian authorities discreetly set free two suspected Israeli spies. "Our political leaders have already told President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ministers that this man is innocent and we believe Egyptian justice will show this," said the Israeli embassy's minister counsellor Koby Brosch. "I don't even want to think he (Azam) will not face a fair trial, I am sure he will," he said. The other defendants in the espionage case are 34-year-old Egyptian Emad Abdelhamid Ismail and two Israeli women who are not in Egypt -- Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna. Prosecutors allege that Ismail agreed to help the two women spy for Israel's intelligence service Mossad when he went to Israel in 1996 to train at a women's garments factory. Greiss, with whom the prosecution said Ismail was having an affair, gave the Egyptian $650 when he was recruited and Shawahna offered to pay him $1,000 a month if he helped Mossad, according to the charge sheet. Azam's alleged role in the espionage case was to deliver to Ismail women's underwear inscribed with invisible ink. The prosecution has not said what information Mossad was seeking but said that Azam and Ismail had both confessed. Azam denied the spying charges in December in his first public appearance in an Egyptian court for a hearing to extend his detention. Egypt became the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in 1979 but relations have been cool at the best of times and took a turn for the worse since the right-wing Netanyahu came to power last year. Israel's groundbreaking last month to build a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem fuelled the tension. An Egyptian news magazine last month said Egypt secretly executed an Egyptian man for spying for Mossad two years ago. In a separate case, Egypt's counter-espionage service has in its custody 47-year-old Egyptian Samir Osman who is suspected of selling military information to Mossad. Osman has not been charged yet.
83167>>0>> Blue-chip stocks retreated quickly Thursday after an early earnings-driven jump in the shares of International Business Machines Corp. sparked a rise of nearly 80 points in the Dow Jones industrial average. At 1 p.m. EDT, the Dow was off 13.24 points at 6,799.48 after the blue-chip index topped out at 6,890.59, which was just short of a key upside resistance at 6,900. In the broader market, advancing issues led declines by a small margin on volume of 282 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The market's pullback was led by a drop in the shares of AlliedSignal Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co., both of which reported quarterly earnings. IBM leaped 10-7/8 to 153-1/4 on its better-than-expected earnings, which were reported after the close of trading Wednesday. It earned $1.19 billion, or $2.37 a share, well above Wall Street estimates for $2.28 a share. The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index, which was also energised by IBM's earnings, slid off its highs but remained in positive territory, with a gain of 4.86 points to 1,232.00. "The weakness can be attributed to some gain in the long bond yield and technical resistance at 6,900," said Eugene Peroni, chief technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. "I think that 6,900 is a key technical point in the Dow. We had a big move this week, and some stocks in the Dow are overbought. They need to come back down to their mid-levels," he said. AlliedSignal was down 2-1/8 at 71-5/8 and Procter & Gamble fell 2-1/8 to 123-5/8. In the bond market, the 30-year Treasury was off 5/32 point, raising its yield to 7.10 percent from 7.08 percent at Wednesday's close. The price and yield move in opposite directions. Larry Wachtel, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said stock traders were cautious ahead of economic reports next week that could threaten the bond market, including the jobs report. "First of all, half of the move today was one stock," Wachtel said, referring to IBM. "The question is should we press this advance forward ahead of the economic reports and run the risk of having the bond market against us? It's asking too much to keep going because some quarters came in well," he said. Among special situations, Dow Chemical Co. rose 1-7/8 at 81-5/8 after it reported flat first quarter earnings but said it expected a strong quarter in the second quarter. Computer Associates International Inc. jumped as much as 14 percent after the giant software company said its latest quarterly earnings likely would be better than Wall Street expected. The stock was up 4-1/2 at 48-1/2.
83167>>0>> An Israeli textile worker went on trial in Cairo on Thursday on charges of spying for the Jewish state and damaging Egypt's national interests. Azam Azam, a 35-year-old chief mechanic, and alleged Egyptian accomplice Emad Abdelhamid Ismail could face 15 years in jail with hard labour if convicted. At the start of the session, Azam and Ismail both told the judge they were not guilty. On arrival Azam had told reporters: "By God Almighty, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything." Azam's lawyer, Farid el-Deeb, said the charge sheet referred only to economic espionage and the maximum penalty was 15 years, compared with life imprisonment for other forms of spying. He said Azam and Ismail were accused of trying to obtain information about Egyptian factories such as those in the industrial satellite city of 10th of Ramadan City. The Egyptian state has never said what kind of information they think Azam was seeking but they have have said the Israeli intelligence service Mossad was behind him. Israeli embassy first secretary David Govrin said he thought the trial would be fair and the court would acquit Azam. "We are sure he is innocent and hope that the court will come to this conclusion as soon as possible," he added. Asaad Asaad, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a former Knesset member, said: "I personally and Azam's family and most of the Israeli people trust the Egyptian legal system and its fairness." Asaad, like Azam a member of Israel's small Druze community, is attending the trial as an observer. Netanyahu had asked President Hosni Mubarak to set Azam free but Mubarak said he could not interfere with the judiciary. Azam, who was working at an Israeli textile factory in a north Cairo suburb at the time of his arrest last November, went on trial at the South Cairo Supreme State Security Court. Govrin said the case had already damaged economic relations between Egypt and the Jewish state. "After he was arrested, the textile factory was closed. Of course Israeli businessmen are not encouraged, to say the least, to invest here due to the fact that they might be arrested," he said. Other defendants in the espionage case are Ismail, 34, and two Israeli women who are not in Egypt -- Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna. Prosecutors say that Ismail agreed to help the two women spy for Mossad when he went to Israel in 1996 to train at a women's garment factory. Greiss, with whom the prosecution said Ismail was having an affair, gave the Egyptian $650 when he was recruited and Shawahna offered to pay him $1,000 a month if he helped Mossad, according to the charge sheet. Azam's alleged role in the espionage case was to deliver to Ismail women's underwear inscribed with invisible ink.
83167>>0>> A senior aide to late president Francois Mitterrand said on Friday the president personally ordered the wiretapping of a newspaper reporter, but said it was justified on grounds of national security. Gilles Menage, former head of Mitterrand's private office, gave the testimony to a judge investigating allegedly illegal phone taps by Mitterrand's anti-terrorism unit. His statement defied a government order to respect official secrets. Menage told reporters the president ordered the bugging because Edqy Plenel, investigative reporter for influential daily Le Monde, published sensitive information about Soviet espionage activity in France. The articles, published in March and April 1985, reproduced "unseen documents of Soviet origin classified very secret", Menage said. "The president considered that these revelations constituted an extremely serious attack on the diplomatic interests of France," he told reporters after his session with Jean-Paul Valat, the investigating judge. Menage is under investigation for allegedly authorising the anti-terrorism unit in Mitterrand's office to carry out widespread illegal bugging of journalists, lawyers and politicians from 1982 to 1986. Menage said Mitterrand believed Plenel's articles would put French counter-espionage agents at risk by exposing how a Soviet spy network in France had been unmasked. The articles "represented a very serious threat to the people or the network that took part in that counter espionage operation," Menage said. Plenel told Reuters by telephone the explanation was nothing more than a "smokescreen" and that even if true, the tapping of his telephone still violated freedom of the press laws. Menage said on Friday he explained to Valat why lawyer Antoine Comte and writer Jean-Edern Hallier, who died recently, were wiretapped, but refused to tell reporters the reasons. Under a 1991 law, phone taps can be carried out only on grounds of national security, safeguarding economic or scientific interests, and the fight against terrorism, crime or organised crime. Mitterrand, who served from 1981 to 1995, died last year of prostate cancer just eight months after leaving office.

83167>>0>> A Cairo court has decided to detain for another 45 days an Egyptian who served in the army and who it suspects sold military information to Israel's secret service Mossad, security sources said on Tuesday. They said the military prosecutor had also decided to refer the case to a civilian court after Samir Osman's confessions did not include any military information. Under Egyptian law, the military courts try people who confess to giving out military information or are in the ranks of the armed forces. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has also referred Moslem militants seeking to overthrow his government to emergency military courts. Osman, 47, was arrested and held without charge in late 1996. Counter-espionage forces have said Osman met Mossad agents in Greece, Turkey and Hungary or by scuba diving to Israel from the border resort of Taba. Egyptian government newspapers had said Osman had confessed to providing Mossad with information about the Egyptian navy and the place where he served in the Egyptian military. The civilian trial of Azam Azam, an Arab-Israeli charged with spying for Israel, opened in Cairo last week. The trial has helped bring relations between Egypt and Israel to their lowest ebb for years.

83167>>0>> Former U.S. Navy intelligence employee Robert Kim, accused of espionage for passing classified information to South Korea last year, is expected to plead guilty, the Justice Department said on Monday. A department spokesman said a court hearing has been set for Wednesday in Alexandria, Virginia, for Kim to enter his guilty plea. A court official confirmed the hearing has been scheduled for the entering of the guilty plea. A federal grand jury indicted Kim on three espionage counts in March, charging that he gave or attempted to give seven documents relating to the U.S. national defence to a South Korean official. Kim, 56, who had been a civilian computer specialist with the Navy since 1978, had access to top-secret information during his military career. The Korean-born Kim became a U.S. citizen in 1974. He initially pleaded not guilty to the charges and a trial had been planned for July. Details of the plea deal were not immediately available. The espionage charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole. Kim was arrested in September at a diplomatic reception at Fort Myer, Virginia and charged with passing classified information to South Korean Navy Capt. Baek Dong-Il, who worked at the South Korean embassy. Kim has remained in jail without bail since his arrest. He was dismissed from the Navy after his arrest.

83167>>0>> Egypt's state security prosecutors on Monday brought a new charge carrying the death penalty against an Israeli textile worker on trial for spying against Egypt, security sources said. They said the new charge was that Azam Azam had made a criminal agreement with an Egyptian and two Israeli women to spy for the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. His previous charge was that he assisted in economic espionage by giving women's underwear inscribed with invisible ink from Mossad to the Egyptian. It carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison with hard labour. Azam went on trial in Cairo with alleged Egyptian accomplice Emad Abdelhamid Ismail on April 24. Both men denied they had spied against Egypt. The trail is to resume on May 18. The other defendants in the case are Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna, who are not in Egypt. Like Azam, they belong to Israel's Druze community. The sources said Azam's new charge was read to him in his prison cell. It said he had "made a criminal agreement" with the other three defendants to "carry out the crime of spying for Israel and that he presented a sum of money in return for this espionage". The charge carries the deast penalty, the sources said. It was not clear to whom Azam was accused of giving the money. Prosecutors said at the trial that Greiss gave Ismail $650 when he was recruited and Shawahna offered to pay him $1,000 a month if he helped Mossad. They said Ismail agreed to help the two women spy for Mossad when he went to Israel in 1996 to train at a women's garment factory. Azam's lawyer said at the time of the trial that his client faced a maximum penalty of 15 years because he was accused of economic espionage. He said Azam and Ismail were accused of trying to obtain information about Egyptian factories such as those in the industrial satellite city of 10th of Ramadan City. Azam's trial has brought Egyptian-Israeli relations to one of their lowest points since the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979.

The espionage charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole. Kim was arrested in September at a diplomatic reception at Fort Myer, Virginia and charged with passing classified information to South Korean Navy Capt. Baek Dong-Il, who worked at the South Korean embassy. The Washington Post in its Tuesday editions quoted sources close to the case saying that Kim would plead guilty to lesser charges of gathering, transmitting or losing defence information. Under the original indictment, Kim faced the possibility of life in prison, but the lesser charges carry a maximum sentence of 10 years, according to the newspaper report. Kim has remained in jail without bail since his arrest. He was dismissed from the Navy after his arrest.
83167>>0>> Former U.S. Navy intelligence employee Robert Kim pleaded guilty Wednesday to a reduced espionage charge involving the passing of defence information to South Korea last year. As part of a plea deal with prosecutors, Kim, 57, who had been a civilian computer specialist with the Navy since 1978, admitted his guilt to conspiring to obtain national defence information that was used by South Korea. Asked how he was pleading to the new charge, Kim responded in a clear voice during the brief court hearing, "I'm guilty." Kim had been indicted on three more serious espionage counts in March, charging that he gave or attempted to give seven U.S. national defence documents to a military official at the South Korean embassy. The documents involved classified information on North and South Korea, China and a computer maritime tracking system. The initial espionage charges carried a maximum penalty of life in prison, but the reduced charge provided for at most a 10-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine. He also faces between two and three years on probation. Under the plea deal, prosecutors agreed to drop the more serious charges. U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema accepted the guilty plea from the Korean-born Kim, who became a U.S. citizen in 1974. The plea deal spared prosecutors from having to present their case at trial, which had been set to begin in July. The judge set sentencing for July 11. Kim was arrested in September at a diplomatic reception at Fort Myer, Virginia, and charged with passing classified information to a South Korean Navy captain who worked at the embassy. Kim has been in jail since his arrest. He was dismissed from the Navy after his arrest. Defence lawyers said that Kim, who received no money for the documents, only wanted to assist South Korea and never intended to hurt the United States.

83167>>0>> Fistfights broke out on Sunday between Egyptian lawyers at the trial of Israeli Druze textile mechanic Azam Azam, accused of spying against Egypt for Israel. Azam, 35, and alleged Egyptian accomplice Emad Abdelhamid Ismail, who were kept in a courtroom cage, are charged with two Israeli Druze women of making a criminal agreement to spy for Israel's secret service, Mossad. The women are being tried in absentia. Azam's lawyer Farid el-Deeb said his client faced a maximum of 15 years in prison with hard labour whereas Ismail could face life imprisonment with hard labour because he was a state-employed teacher. Ismail's lawyer said the maximum punishment for all defendants could be life imprisonment. One lawyer, representing the Egyptian Lawyers' Union, accused Azam's attorney of being a traitor for agreeing to represent the Israeli. Assistants for the two lawyers were entangled in fistfights and swore at each other as soon as the judge left the courtroom after he adjourned the trial till June 14. "The (lawyers') union will hold a disciplinary hearing on this lawyer (Deeb). He has sold his conscience and betrayed his country for $4 million," said Mortada Mohsen, referring to what he said was the fee Azam's family paid Deeb. "I want to raise a civil case demanding $100 million compensation from the Israeli government, Azam and his co-defendants and donate it to the martyrs of the Qana massacre that Israel carried out," Mohsen told reporters. About 100 people were killed after Israeli shells hit a U.N. military base in Qana, Lebanon in April 1996. The judge turned down Mohsen's request to add the civil suit to the case, being heard at South Cairo State Security court, and said that if Deeb had not agreed to represent Azam, the court would have appointed another Egyptian lawyer. "This is an attempt to disrupt the court proceedings," Deeb said of Mohsen's charges. "To say I am a traitor is libellous, and I will not respond to libel." Azam's brother denied his family agreed to pay Deeb $4 million but said he was still optimistic Azam would be set free. "If we had $4 million we would have been rich. We are poor, simple people. We collected money from people and we still haven't paid the fee," said Sami Azam. "Azam is innocent and I am very optimistic that he will go home, God willing." Sami said Mohsen was upset because Azam's family had considered hiring him but chose Deeb instead. "I would have completely refused. I can't betray my country. When (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu first came here I sent a telegram to the Israeli embassy in Cairo saying 'Leave the pure land of Egypt, you dirty person'," Mohsen said. The trial, which started on April 24, has brought Egyptian-Israeli relations to one of their lowest ebbs since the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979. At one point in the session, state security policemen had to encircle the bench where Israeli diplomats and Azam's family and friends were sitting to protect them from one lawyer who insisted they be moved to make room for him. "It's a shame that an Egyptian lawyer can curse our prime minister here in public," said David Govrin, first secretary at the Israeli embassy. "We hope the court will release Azam. We know the charges are baseless and we're waiting for the decision of the court. We are 100 percent sure that Azam is innocent," he added. Egyptian state security prosecutors on May 5 brought a new, more severe charge against Azam, accusing him of agreeing with Ismail and the two women to spy for Mossad. His previous charge was that he assisted in economic espionage by giving women's underwear inscribed with invisible ink form Mossad to Ismail. Prosecutors state in the charge sheet that Mossad wanted information on Egyptian factories. They said the women offered Ismail money to work for Mossad when he went to Israel in 1996 to train at a women's garment factory.
83167>>0>> General Motors Corp plans to build a new low-cost car in Brazil that would sell for about $9,000 and utilize production techniques that maximize efficiency, industry analysts and two published reports said Monday. GM's new car, code-named "Blue Macaw," is expected to undercut the $11,000 price of Ford Motor Co's new Ka small car in Brazil, and Fiat SpA's Uno, currently the country's cheapest car at $10,000.   The Wall Street Journal and the trade weekly Automotive News quoted GM officials in Brazil as saying the new car will be built in a new, $600 million assembly plant that the company is building in southern part of the country. With a such a low price -- including sales taxes -- GM hopes the car will open up a new market of consumers who previously could not afford to buy cars and trucks, the reports said.   In addition to the GM assembly line, the plant will house about 20 outside suppliers that will build major parts sub-assemblies for the vehicle. Many of the concepts used were first developed by J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former GM purchasing chief who was accused of industrial espionage when he abruptly quit and joined Volkswagen AG in 1993. Plans for Lopez' so-called Plant X were among the alleged documents that GM accused him of stealing and bringing to VW. The German automaker has built a plant using similar techniques in Resende, Brazil.   GM officials in Detroit declined to comment on the reports and referred calls to the automaker's public relations office in Brazil, which did not return telephone calls on Monday. GM is hosting hundreds of supplier executives in Rio de Janeiro for its annual Supplier of the Year awards ceremonies. Michael Robinet, an automotive consultant with CSM Forecasting in Farmington Hills, Mich., said the Blue Macaw vehicle is based on GM's next-generation Opel Corsa platform. He described as a "stripped-down Corsa." "This will meet the Ka on its own turf," said Robinet, who researches new product programs for automotive suppliers.

Ford's Ka is based on the European Fiesta platform, which the company also is starting to produce in Brazil. Automotive News quoted Marcos Munhoz, GM's director of materials management, as saying that outside suppliers will build all of the car's major components except the engine, transmission and the exterior body panels. GM workers will fabricate the body, paint it and perform final assembly. The Journal said global volumes of such a small car could reach 1 million units as GM expands into developing countries. "When you think about emerging markets like China, India and Central Europe, at this price point, you could get into that level of volume," Mark Hogan, GM's director of small car development, told the newspaper.
83167>>0>> German authorities investigating allegations that workers at carmaker Volkswagen AG took bribes for contracts said Thursday they had gathered "wide-ranging documents" in raids over the past three days. Public prosecutors in Braunschweig, near VW's Wolfsburg headquarters, said the documents were collected in 14 offices and homes throughout Germany. They said they extended their investigation to cover 12 people, up from two previously. Swiss-Swedish engineering group ABB has alleged that some VW workers demanded and received 20 million marks ($12 million) in return for a factory contract at VW's Czech Skoda unit. VW, which on its own initiative asked for the investigation by Braunschweig prosecutors, reaffirmed that it welcomed the probe. "We welcome a full and complete investigation of the allegations, whether it be against people inside or outside the corporation," VW said in a statement. ABB alleged last December that a VW employee demanded bribes for the Skoda contract. It refused to pay the disputed costs, prompting both companies to contact German and Swiss prosecutors.

83167>>0>> A former clerk with the National Security Agency was sentenced to 18 years in prison and a $10,000 fine in federal court on Friday for selling secrets to the Soviet Union 30 years ago. The sentence came in a bargain for Robert Lipka's guilty plea to selling top-secret National Security Agency documents to Soviet espionage agents. The offences involved photographing the papers while Lipka, from Millersville, Pa., worked as a clerk at National Security Agency headquarters at Fort Meade, Md., from 1965 through 1967. The government alleged Lipka, 51, collected $27,000 from his handlers. He was not arrested until 1996, when the FBI cited statements he had made to an unnamed witness. The deal required Lipka to plead guilty to a single count of conspiring to commit espionage. It also required him to get clearance for any statements and turn over to the government any fees for his story. In return, prosecutors said, top-secret documents and a sensitive witness would be shielded.

83167>>0>> A former Russian defence industry official went on trial in Moscow on Wednesday charged with spying for Britain, Russian news agencies said. Vadim Sintsov, former director of foreign economic relations at the Special Machine-Building and Metallurgy firm is charged with "treason and receiving especially large bribes", they said. In London, a British Foreign office spokesman refused to give any reaction, saying: "We never comment on intelligence matters". Lintsov was arrested in January, 1994, on "incontrovertible evidence" that he had been recruited by the British security services, the agencies said, quoting the Federal Security Service (FSB), successor organisation to the KGB. "An investigation by the chief military prosecutor established that, having been recruited by the British, Vadim Sintsov collected and handed over state secrets, damaging Russia's defence capabilities, state security and economic interests," Itar-Tass news agency said. Sintsov is also charged with receiving bribes from representatives of various foreign firms, the agencies said, quoting investigation materials. The judge presiding over the case at the military board of the Russian Supreme Court, Major General Lev Zakharov, said the case would last for more than a week because of the weight of evidence to be heard. If convicted, Lintsov would face a sentence of between 12 and 20 years in jail. Espionage still goes on actively between Russia and her former foes, despite the end of the Cold War. The FSB has said it exposed 400 foreign agents and 39 Rusian spies in 1995 and 1996 alone.

Ecuadorean President Fabian Alarcon was appointed interim president until August 1998 by Congress in February, after former President Abdala Bucaram was deposed. Central bank officials in London ahead of the economic policy announcement outlined the country's current economic programme which is expected to be kept in place. Central Bank of Ecuador technical director Mauricio Valencia said the economic programme provided a basis for a stand-by agreement with the International Monetary Fund and a subsequent Paris Club restructuring. The team will meet with the Paris Club on Thursday, ahead of further investor presentations in Madrid and Amsterdam. The team has also visited New York. "There is a necessity for us to normalise our relations with the Paris Club members," Pareja said. He said the economic programme focused on reducing the fiscal deficit, "the main problem" in Ecuador. A key objective was for a budget deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP in 1997 and 1.3 percent in 1998, he said. Pareja said attainable measures to achieve a deficit reduction were spending cuts, which included the "elimination of positions". There were also revenue enhancement schemes which included the reimbursement of EMELEC debt, increased customs revenues, increased import tariffs and an increase in electricity rates. But when asked whether Ecuador planned to increase taxes to raise revenues Pareja said that would not be immediately possible. "There's no room to increase taxes now, the political constraint is very strong," he said. "We could introduce tax reforms by the year-end but for now it is difficult." He said Value Added Tax could be introduced by the end of the year. -- Hayley Pienaar, London Newsroom +44 171 542 7718
83167>>0>> A closed-door session chaired by top central bankers at the International Monetary Conference (IMC) focused on banking supervision and central bankers did not discuss economic policy, sources said. "(US Federal Reserve chief Alan) Greenspan did not speak about the U.S. economy," one North American commercial banker told Reuters. Another European banker confirmed the three-hour session with central bankers and leading commercial bankers dealt with supervisory issues and was largely technical in nature. -- Zurich Editorial +41 1 631 7340
83167>>0>> With no key economic data due until later in the week, U.S. Treasuries are expected to stick to very tight ranges on Tuesday, mainly focusing on technical factors, players said. The market, unable to sustain Friday's runup on Monday, offers more downside risk amid a steady stream of corporate and asset-backed supply. Losses are seen limited, however, since the market anticipates bond-friendly economic news beginning on Thursday.
83167>>0>> A Cairo state security court on Monday extended for another 45 days the detention of a former member of the Egyptian navy suspected of spying for Israel, security sources said. Samir Osman, 47, was arrested and held without charge in late 1996. Counter-espionage forces have said Osman met Israel's secret service Mossad agents in Greece, Turkey and Hungary or by scuba diving to Israel from the border resort of Taba. Military prosecutors had earlier decided to refer the case to a civilian court after Samir Osman's confessions did not include any military information. But Egyptian government newspapers had said Osman had confessed to providing Mossad with information about the Egyptian navy and the place where he served in the Egyptian military. Under Egyptian law, military courts try people who confess to giving out military information or are in the ranks of the armed forces. The civilian trial of Azam Azam, an Israeli Druze charged along with three other people of spying for Israel opened in Cairo and April.
83167>>0>> The World Bank's International Development Association has granted Zambia SDR 32.6 million ($45.5 million) in credit for the private sector, Commerce and Trade Minister Alfeyo Hambayi said on Wednesday. "This facility, which is known as the enterprise development project, is a result of negotiations which have been going on between the Zambian government and the World Bank since 1995," Hambayi told a news conference. The deal would provide investment credit and working capital for exporters and technical support to firms developing business and investment strategies. The grant would also provide technical and financial support to financial institutions, non-governmental organisations and business groups. It includes about $30 million in long-term investment credit and $10 million in export pre-shipment credit. The project also includes a matching grant scheme of $3.5 million to help private firms to restructure and $1.1 million in technical assistance to the central bank, commercial banks and the Export Board of Zambia. "This integrated package of financial and institutional support to the private sector is very important as it is expected to stimulate the supply response within the framework of the economic restructuring and reforms currently being undertaken by the government," Hambayi said.

83167>>0>> Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Friday. LONDON - The UK's FTSE 100 index was driven to its third record close this week by the U.S. stock market's seemingly unstoppable rise and by fresh domestic bid activity which helped boost investor confidence. The FTSE 100 closed at 4,783.1, up 25.7 points, or 0.54 percent. This was up 161.80 from last Friday. FRANKFURT - Equities ended trade at a record closing high, lifted by Wall Street's strongest bull run in history and after a firm dollar propelled the equity market higher.

In later screen-based trade the IBIS DAX index ended at 3,752.37, up 15.21 points, or 0.41 percent. PARIS - Friday the 13th proved lucky for the Paris bourse, which surged 1.75 percent to close at an all-time closing high. Traders said comments from the German-French summit, which made progress on a European Union budget stability pact, helped push up the market, which earlier hit a session high of 2,811.86 before retracing. The market was also buoyed by weak U.S. producer prices data and the bull run on Wall Street. The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 48.25 points, or 1.75 percent, at 2,808.52, a rise of 89.27 from last week. ZURICH - Shares ended a mixed session at a record level although the blue-chip SMI index failed to overcome resistance at 5,400. Dealers said Wall Street's firm opening gave the market a late push higher. The Swiss market index closed at 5,384.6, up 20.4 points, or 0.38 percent, and up 80 points on the week. MILAN - Shares closed higher in a flurry of across-the-board buying, spurred by hopes of a breakthough in agreeing an EMU stability pact and U.S. data conveying a picture of non-inflationary growth. The All Share Mibtel index closed at 12,761, up 292 points, or 2.33 percent, up 484 points on the week. AMSTERDAM - Shares closed at a record high, the seventh in the last 10 trading sessions, boosted by a surge on Wall Street following U.S. Producer Price data which pointed to tame inflation. The AEX index closed at 846.09, up 6.73 points, or 0.80 percent, or up 21.66 points on the week. TOKYO - Stocks ended the session marginally lower. Morning gains on the June futures and options settlement lifted the benchmark to a new high for calendar 1997, but it later melted on profit-taking ahead of the weekend. The 225-share Nikkei average closed at 20,528.35, down 36.11 points, or 0.18 percent. This was 42.60 down from last Friday. HONG KONG - Stocks closed higher following volatile trade, with the Hang Seng Index recovering some of Thursday's sharp losses after finding support at the 13,800 level in morning trade, brokers said. The Hang Seng index closed at 14,112.55, up 188.21 points, or 1.35 percent, a drop of 542.58 points on the week. SYDNEY - Shares capped a strong week with a record close, the market healthy enough to absorb profit-taking on News Corp and bank stocks which posted strong gains on Thursday. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,655.3, up 17.2 points, or 0.65 percent, a rise of 54.4 from the previous Friday's close. JOHANNESBURG - Shares ended flat in listless trade, but a swathe of overnight foreign assets swaps boostd volumes as Gencor closed with 4.1 million shares traded on the counter, dealers said. The All-share index closed at 7,271.5, down 21.2 points, or 0.29 percent, up 9.3 from a week ago. The All Gold index closed at 1,129.0, down 19.1 points, or 0.23 percent, a drop of 46.6 since last week.

83167>>0>> A former U.S. Army clerk, charged with spying for Hungary and Czechoslovakia during the Cold War, will have to remain in federal custody until her trial, a U.S. magistrate ruled on Friday. U.S. Magistrate Claude Hicks declared Kelly Therese Warren an escape risk and, calling espionage the most serious federal crime, ordered her to remain in custody. Warren, 31, had asked Hicks through her attorney to set bond so that she could return home to nearby Warner Robins, Georgia. The decision means Warren will be transferred from the Macon County jail to a federal facility in Tampa, Florida, U.S. officials said. She was expected to be tried in U.S. District Court in Tampa this year. Warren was the fifth person to be charged with taking part in a spy ring that passed secret U.S. and NATO defence plans to Hungary and Czechoslovakia in the mid-1980s. She served in the 8th Infantry Division headquarters at Bad Kreuznach, in what was then West Germany, from 1986 to 1988. She worked in the administration of the G-3 Section, where her duties included preparing classified documents for publication and distribution, a federal indictment said. G-3 was responsible for planning and training the 8th Infantry for the defence of Western Europe in the event of attack from Warsaw Pact countries. Federal prosecutors claim Warren passed documents on to espionage ringleader Sgt. 1st Class Clyde Lee Conrad, who gave them to communist agents. Conrad was convicted of high treason in Germany in 1990 and sentenced to life in prison, the stiffest sentence given for espionage by a German court since the Second World War. "On 50 or more occasions she passed highly classified documents to Conrad," assistant U.S. Attorney Walter Furr told the magistrate on Friday. "She paid off bills. When she got out of the Army, she took and blew the money she'd made off of espionage (by) partying." Warren has been married twice, has a 10-year-old daughter and had been living in a mobile home. Until her arrest on Tuesday, she worked in the parts department of a mobile home sales store on the outskirts of Warner Robins Air Force Base.
83167>>0>> Carmaker Adam Opel AG, a unit of General Motors Corp, said on Friday it has extended the contract of Opel managing director David Herman for five Herman, 51, was named to head Opel in July 1992 and has spent most of the last five years battling rival Volkswagen AG over allegations of corporate spying by former GM executive Jose Ignacio Lopez when he defected to VW in 1993. Opel said the supervisory board cited the efforts of Herman, who is also a GM vice president, to improve the competitiveness of Opel's plants in Germany as one reason for extending his contract. The move was considered unusual because, since the the early 1980s, Opel generally changed managing directors on a three-year rotation. Industry officials had also speculated Herman would be replaced as part of a shake-up at GM. One potential replacement was Mark Hogan, 45, who was recently named general manager of operations for GM's North American Operations Small Car Group. In January, shortly after announcing a deal to end the dispute with VW, Herman himself prompted speculation about his possibly leaving Opel when he said he had devoted most of his time to the VW fight and wanted to return to making cars. Opel and VW reached a deal in Germany under which VW would pay the carmaker $1 billion and agree to buy billions of marks worth of parts over the next seven years from GM units. Opel agreed in return to drop racketeering lawsuits in the U.S. Opel officials said the renewal of Herman's contract indicated approval from top GM executives for the man and his plans to expand the carmaker's operations into eastern Europe and Russia. "This is confirmation that he was been doing the right things over the last five years," said one Opel official. Opel will hold its annual news conference next Thursday in Frankfurt. The carmaker said in February it expected a profit for 1996 of between 300 and 350 million marks compared with 363 million marks ($210 million) in 1995. --John Gilardi, Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525 ($ = 1.728 German Marks)
83167>>0>> An anti-Israel demonstration broke out on Saturday at a heavily guarded Cairo courthouse where an Israeli textile worker is being tried for spying against Egypt in one of the country's most high-profile cases. "Zionism, Zionism, get out of Egypt. Traitors, traitors," chanted lawyer Mortada Mohsen, eachoed by more than fifty people. "Oh you fool, (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu, the blood of our brothers will not be spilled in vain." A squad of riot police and special security forces pushed back the crowd and tried to keep order in the courthouse where Israeli Druze Azam Azam and his Egyptian alleged accomplice Emad Abdelhalim Ismail are being tried on charges of making a criminal arrangement to spy for Israel's secret service Mossad. Two Israeli women are also being tried in absentia in the case, which began on April 24 and dragged Egyptian-Israeli relations to one of their lowest points since the two states signed a peace treaty in 1979. "It's a shame how this case has been blown out of proportion by the press and the public, but we have full confidence in the Egyptian legal system," said Asaad Asaad, a member of the minority Druze community who is an adviser to Netanyahu. "Even relations between Egypt and Israel are better. Egypt replaced the United States as the main mediator in the peace," he added, referring to Cairo's attempts to restart deadlocked peace talks between Israel and its Palestinian peace partners. The case was adjourned until next Tuesday. Lawyers punched and insulted each other at the last session of the trial, prompting the heavy security. The press has devoted many pages to the case, with some colunmists saying the court could not "find it in its heart to acquit the Israeli." Farid el-Deeb, lawyer for Azam, who is in his late 20s, has said his client faces a maximum 15 years in prison with hard labour while Ismail could be given a life sentence because he was a civil servant. Ahmed Bakr, Ismail's lawyer, said both men faced a maximum sentence of life imprisonment but hinted his client might get a lighter sentence or maybe even none at all because of the confessions he made to the prosecutor. "We can't say whether he's innocent or not; what we can say is that he was deceived. He's a young man who wants to have a good life and others took advantage of that and this is where it led him," Bakr said beside the prosecution cage while tears coursed down Ismail's cheeks. "I love this country, in spite of everything, it's my home. If there's one thing that I am certain of, it's that I'm innocent," said Ismail, 35, who was a state-employed teacher. According to reports published in the state-run press, Ismail confessed to having sex with one of the Israeli women, and of being blackmailed by photographs of their activities into working for Mossad. He said Azam gave him women's underwear inscribed with invisible ink to carry into Egypt for Mossad. Defence lawyer Deeb told the court the chemist who examined the underwear was not qualified to handle such an investigation. He then spent most of the two-hour session in debate with the prosecution about the legality of a new, more severe charge brought against Azam earlier this month. Egyptian state security prosecutors on May 5 accused Azam of agreeing with Ismail and the two women to spy for Mossad. His previous charge was that he assisted in economic espionage by giving the Mossad-inscribed underwear to Ismail. Prosecutors also state in the charge sheet that Mossad wanted information on Egyptian factories. They said the women offered Ismail money to work for Mossad when he went to Israel in 1996 to train at a women's garment factory.
83167>>0>> At least 50 people were feared drowned when a ferry capsized in Bangladesh in what one policeman described as a "fierce whirlpool", the official BSS news agency said on Saturday. The ferry, carrying some 250 passengers, overturned in strong currents on the Dhanu river northeast of Dhaka on Friday. About 200 people swam ashore but the rest were missing, the agency said. Rescuers recovered the body of a boy on Friday night, it said, but gave no details. Police said on Saturday evening that fire brigade divers had been searching for more bodies but without success. "The ferry sank in a fierce whirlpool...and rescuers are having serious difficulty. They have not been able to locate the sunken vessel or recover any victims," one police officer told reporters. He said the water was some 200 feet (65 metres) deep where the ferry went down and the bodies had perhaps been swept far downstream.

83167>>0>> The head of Adam Opel AG said Monday the German automaker would defend its top spot in Europe despite plans by parent General Motors Corp. to use Opel to launch an ambitious global expansion plan. Opel managing director David Herman told Reuters that the company would keep building vehicles to meet German and European interests and that the international expansion plan was critical to securing Opel's future. "Anyone who says you can afford somehow to turn your eyes away from Germany and Europe is making a mistake," Herman, whose contract was renewed last week for another five years, said in an interview at Opel's headquarters outside Frankfurt. "We are not doing that. I think we should earn a little bit of time before people make up their minds." A weekend report in Der Spiegel magazine said an internal survey of top GM officials in Europe criticised GM's expansion strategy, saying the automaker needed to devote more resources to European product development and quality measures. Some Opel officials have also complained privately that top managers were being taken away from Opel tasks for the project under the direction of GM International President Louis Hughes, hampering development of new Opel models. Herman said he stood behind the GM expansion plan, which calls for Opel to be used as a base to boost output by about 700,000 vehicles early next century through new plants in such countries as Argentina, Poland, Brazil, Thailand and China. "I want to see Opel as an even larger participant in growing world markets," he said. "We have the resources, both financially and in human resources, for these projects." Opel is helping to develop several plants since many will produce Opel vehicles. It will then turn many of the plants over to GM and receive royalty payments from production. Herman also said the resignation last week of Juergen Stockmar, a top Opel board member, was due to personal reasons and not his dissatisfaction with GM's expansion plans, which includes reducing the number of vehicle platforms to seven from the current 16 in coming years. German media reports said Stockmar, the Opel board member in charge of technical development, quit in protest over having too little time to devote to work on Opel products. "He did not think they were not good strategies. He personally had another vision of what he wanted to do, which was to stay here and work on the European challenges for Opel," Herman said of Stockmar, who was replaced by Peter Hanenberger. Opel, like rival automakers Volkswagen AG and Ford Motor Co., has seen its market share erode this year and is under pressure to offer new products to regain lost sales. Opel's market share dropped to 11.8 percent in the first five months of 1997 from 12.4 percent a year earlier, while sales dropped 4 percent to 689,694 vehicles. Herman said one reason for Opel's slow sales was intense price pressure and big sales incentives from Asian automakers.

Ford's sales have fallen six percent to 649,383 and its market share to 11.1 percent from 11.9. "All of the volume makers have lost market share. But on a relative basis we have not really lost ground," he said. "Our ambition is to be at about 12 percent at the end of the year." Herman said one reason for Opel's slow sales was intense price pressure and big sales incentives from Asian makers, which boosted their market share to 11.4 percent in the first five months of 1997 from 10.7 percent. "The European car market certainly does not provide much reason for optimism, either from a volume standpoint or from the dynamics within it," he said. Herman also said Opel had not made a final decision on how to deal with excess capacity in the industry. Some media reports have said Opel was considering scenarios to reduce up to 6,000 jobs from its German workforce of 45,000. "It's not based on some notion that we are going to produce less cars or sell less cars in Germany," he said. "New investments and products will allow us to employ less people. This is a process that has been under way for some time." He said Opel did not plan to export vehicles out of central Europe, where it has a growing presence in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, to western European markets. "We are not planning to close down west European plants to import products from cheaper locations," he said. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> The FBI said on Monday it had arrested an employee of a Taiwanese paper company and a professor at a university in Taiwan on charges relating to an alleged plan to steal trade secrets from pharmaceutical firm Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. The FBI said in its arrest warrant and a news release that the two men conspired to illegally acquire, through an FBI undercover agent, plant cell culture technology used to make Taxol, a drug used to fight ovarian cancer. Arrested were Kai-Lo Hsu Hsu, technical director of the Yuen Foong Paper Co Ltd, in Taipei, and Charles Ho, a professor at the National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan. Ho was also described as a co-owner of a Delaware-registered biotechnology firm called Asiapharm. In Taipei, a spokeswoman for Yuen Foong Paper Co Ltd told Reuters that the firm is a subsidiary of Yuen Foong Yu Paper Manufacturing Co Ltd. She said she knew nothing about the FBI arrests. The FBI said Hsu was charged with attempted theft of trade secrets, conspiracy to steal trade secrets, and other violations. Ho was charged with aiding and abetting interstate and foreign travel to commit bribery, and conspiracy. At a court hearing Monday afternoon, the two men were ordered held in advance of a bail hearing on Thursday, assistant U.S. attorney Richard Goldberg said. Asked whether the paper company itself was a target in the investigation, Goldberg declined to comment.
83167>>0>> A Taiwan paper company on Tuesday denied FBI charges that its subsidary planned to steal trade secrets from U.S. pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. "According to our initial understanding, the allegations are completely groundless and untrue," a spokesman for Yuen Foong Yu Paper Manufacturing Co Ltd told Reuters. The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said on Monday it had arrested an employee of Yuen Foong Paper Co Ltd, a subsidiary of Yuen Foong Yu Paper Manufacturing, and a professor at Taiwan's National Chiao Tung University on charges relating to an alleged plan to steal trade secrets from Bristol-Myers. The spokesman, who declined to be identified, said the company was interested in engaging in biotechnology ventures, but denied it intended to steal any trade secrets. He said Yuen Foong was approached by a U.S. investment consulting firm, Mano Associated, to discuss possible technology cooperation. "We have no idea why our people were charged with being involved in the business spy case," the spokesman said. "Frankly, we do not know anything about the trade secrets related to Bristol-Myers." "We have hired lawyers to investigate the case." The FBI said in its arrest warrant and a news release that the two men conspired to illegally acquire, through an FBI undercover agent, plant cell culture technology used to make Taxol, a drug used to fight ovarian cancer. Arrested were Kai-Lo Hsu, technical director of the Yuen Foong Paper in Taipei and Charles Ho, a professor at the National Chiao Tung University. Ho was also described as a co-owner of a Delaware-registered biotechnology firm called Asiapharm. The FBI said Hsu was charged with attempted theft of trade secrets, conspiracy to steal trade secrets and other violations. Ho was charged with aiding and abetting inter-state and foreign travel to commit bribery, and conspiracy.

83167>>0>> The works council of Adam Opel AG demanded on Tuesday that the German carmaker make clear its position on possible job cuts as another top executive quit over parent General Motor Corp's global expansion plan. The Opel works council said recent German media reports saying the carmaker may cut up to 10,000 jobs has created a "storm of controversy" that has caused heightened tensions among the carmaker's 45,000 workers in Germany. The leader of Opel's works council, Rudolf Mueller, said no new new labour contract would be approved until job security issues were clarified by Opel management. "We expect a statement from Opel management about job security and that they will fight with all their strength to save jobs in Germany," Mueller told Reuters. An Opel spokesman declined comment on the statement. But Opel managing director David Herman told Reuters on Monday the carmaker has not yet made a final decision on how to deal with excess capacity in the industry and possible job cuts. "It's not based on some notion that we are going to produce less cars or sell less cars in Germany," he said. "New investments and products will allow us to employ less people. This is a process that has been under way for some time." Opel's troubles were also compounded on Tuesday when GM's European headquarters in Zurich said a senior marketing executive, Jonathan Browning, had quit to join the European operations of rival Ford Motor Co in England. Browning's departure follows the highly-charged resignation last week of Juergen Stockmar, the Opel management board member in charge of technical development. Both executives reportedly quit over GM's ambitious expansion programme into emerging markets and views at the carmaker that Opel's future is being compromised by Detroit taking away top managers and engineers for other projects. A weekend report in Der Spiegel magazine also said an internal survey of top GM officials in Europe criticised GM's expansion strategy, saying the carmaker needed to devote more resources to European product development and quality measures. Opel officials have also complained privately that GM will exploit Opel's resources to build plants in Latin America, Asia and eastern Europe at a time when Opel must develop new products to compete in the stiff European market. Browning worked for GM in Zurich and oversaw marketing efforts for GM's Opel and Vauxhall brands as well as Saab and GM's North American vehicles sold in Europe. Opel officials said Stockmar quit because he was not being given enough time to work on Opel products for the European market, where the carmaker has lost market share in 1997 along with other mass-market car producers. The works council said it was aware of plans for Opel to cut up to 5,000 jobs by 2001, including 1,500 jobs at its main factory in Ruesselsheim, and that it has already told senior Opel management of its objections. But Herman said Opel would keep building vehicles to meet German and European interests and that the international expansion plan was critical to securing Opel's future. The carmaker on Tuesday issued a statement saying it was adding 90 new jobs at its plant in Eisenach, Germany, and would raise production by 15,000 vehicles a year to 177,000. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Lawyers for alleged Israeli spy Azam Azam asked a Cairo court on Tuesday to seek more opinions on one of the key pieces of evidence -- women's underwear the prosecution says were impregnated with secret ink. Lawyer Farid el-Deeb said he wanted the Justice Ministry's forensic science department to see if scientific institutions in Cairo had the equipment to test for the ink. The request was a challenge to the prosecution's reliance on a government chemist who spent 90 minutes on Tuesday in closed-door deliberations with the judge and the lawyers for Azam, a textile engineer arrested in Cairo last year. Azam, an Israeli Druze, and his alleged Egyptian accomplice, Emad Abdelhalim Ismail, face charges of making a criminal arrangement to spy in Egypt for the Israeli secret service Mossad. The trial began on April 24. The prosecution protested against Deeb's request, saying the chemist was entirely competent. But Deeb later told reporters: "The court has yet to decide on the matter (the request)." The charge sheet says that Azam gave women's underwear inscribed with invisible ink from Mossad to Ismail. The other defendants in the case are Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna, who are not in Egypt. Like Azam, they belong to Israel's Druze community. All four defendants are charged with making a criminal agreement to spy for Mossad against Egypt. Prosecutors have said at the trial that Greiss gave Ismail $650 when he was recruited and Shawahna offered to pay him $1,000 a month if he helped Mossad. They said Ismail agreed to help the two women spy for Mossad when he went to Israel in 1996 to train at a women's garment factory. Azam's trial has brought Egyptian-Israeli relations to one of their lowest points since the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979. Asaad Asaad, a prominent Druze figure and an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and members of the Israeli embassy in Cairo attended Tuesday's session. It is not clear what the maximum penalty for the charges is. Azam's lawyer, Deeb, has said his client faces a maximum 15 years in prison with hard labour while Ismail, who had worked as a teacher in a state-run school, could be given a life sentence because he was a civil servant. Ahmed Bakr, Ismail's lawyer, said both men faced a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
83167>>0>> The lawyer for an Egyptian man charged with espionage said on Wednesday his client was forced to confess to spying for Israel and that the prosecution did not have any solid evidence to convict him. Emad Abdelhalim Ismail and Israeli textile engineer Azam Azam are charged with making a criminal arrangement to spy in Egypt for the Israeli secret service Mossad. Two women -- Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna -- are being tried for the same charges but in absentia. Prosecutor Hisham Badawi berated Ismail before the court for betraying his country and said investigations had unearthed a handwritten statement by Ismail saying he was willing to cooperate with Israeli intelligence. "I Emad Abdelhamid Ismail want to live in Israel and am willing to cooperate with Israeli intelligence, and in light of the respect and freedom given to me by Israel, I am more than willing to sacrifice all I own for its people," said Badawi, reading out the statement to the courtroom. "You promised that you would sacrifice everything and now you have and we call for you to be punished," Badawi told Ismail, who looked on belligerently from the courtroom cage. But Ahmed Bakr, Ismail's lawyer, told reporters the prosecution did not have any proof that Ismail was recruited by Mossad and that he was probably duped into confessing. "It's the job of the prosecution to convict, they're not going to tell you they tricked him into confessing, telling him he was a witness and not a defendant," Bakr said. "And there are many types of confessions like those made under duress. I think this was one of them," he added. Both Azam and Ismail face at least 15 years in jail if convicted. The trial, which began on April 24, has brought Egyptian-Israeli relations to one of their lowest points since both countries signed a peace treaty in 1979. Bakr asked the judges to acquit his young Egyptian client, who wept copiously during the session, because he told police at least four times he thought he was being drawn into an Israeli spy ring. The case was adjourned until July 19. "My client is a naive village boy who was deceived by people who took advantage of his lack of exposure to the world but at least his sense of nationalism saved him at the end," Bakr told the courtroom during his 2-1/2 hour address. "The law does not acquit someone for being an idiot but my client felt there was something dangerous going on and went and told the police before they began investigations. Under the law, this is ground for acquittal. "Emad was telling the police: 'Help me, I'm being dragged into the spy ring' but their response was slow," he added. According to the investigations, Azam allegedly gave Ismail ladies underwear impregnated with Mossad's invisible ink to carry into Egypt. Published accounts of Ismail's confession show he was blackmailed into working for Mossad by explicit pictures of his love affair with Greiss and that Shawahnah offered him $1,000 to work for Israeli intelligence. Bakr said there was no proof that Ismail was offered money and that there was no evidence that he knew about the secret ink in the underwear or that he even used it. Farid el-Deeb, Azam's lawyer, wants more tests run on the underwear.
83167>>0>> European Union transport ministers agreed on Wednesday to force ferry operators to record details of passengers and crew carried on longer voyages so as to help rescue services in the event of accidents. Under the new rules, ferries sailing from EU ports will have to count passengers and crews on short trips and register the names, gender and age bracket of passengers and crew on voyages of more than 20 nautical miles. The move is intended to help rescue services target their search efforts, giving them the information they need to know whether people remain to be saved. "When we remind ourselves that it took two whole days in the wake of the sinking of the 'Herald of Free Enterprise' to discover how many people had been lost and who they were, we can only begin to imagine the appalling experience of families," European Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock said. He was referring to the 1987 accident involving a ferry which capsized and sank outside the Belgian port of Zeebrugge after leaving harbour with its bow doors open. "Hopefully, in the event of such tragedies, no one will have to go through that experience again," he told a news conference. Kinnock said the new rules would require registration of passengers and crew on all cross-Channel ferry routes. The European Commission has said lists are essential for the identification of those people killed or injured in an accident and for the treatment of legal issues related to dependants' insurance and inheritance rights. Italy secured a derogation for its busy ferry route across the Straits of Messina, allowing it to set figures for passenger numbers by adding together the maximum capacity of the railway wagons and other vehicles carried instead of by counting heads. The measures, which still require final European parliamentary approval, are set to come into force on the last day of 1999, 18 months later than originally proposed. Wednesday's decision leaves outstanding the other issue raised by the Zeebrugge disaster, and by the later and more murderous "Estonia" ferry sinking in 1994, the question of ferry instability in case of flooding on vehicle decks. Kinnock said progress with ferry design was on the way via an international deal struck in Stockholm, though some disagree. British Labour Euro-MP Mark Watts said in a Reuters interview last March that more should be done. "Since the 'Estonia' sank we have had the Stockholm agreement on maritime safety, but even that does not go far enough because it does not insist on the fundamental design changes that were proposed after the 'Herald' sank," he said. Ministers also agreed on Wednesday to a revision of rules on the training and certification of seafarers.

83167>>0>> U.S. Treasury prices opened slightly lower on Thursday ahead of three significant economic reports. New jobless claims for the week ended on June 14 are expected to come down 333,000 from higher levels posted in the last two weeks, according to economists polled by Reuters. If, contrary to expectations, jobless claims total 340,000 or more in the latest week, that might hint at some cooling in a tight labor market, economists said.   At the same time that the Labor Department releases its 0830 EDT/1230 GMT data on new jobless claims for the latest week, the Commerce Department will release international trade figures for April. Economists polled by Reuters forecast, on average, that the U.S. trade gap widened to $10.0 billion in April from an $8.51 billion deficit in March. Analysts said the April trade data affect the Treasury market indirectly, allowing economists to fine-tune their second-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimates. But the data are more relevant to the currency markets, they said.   The Philadelphia Federal Reserve survey will draw the Treasury market's attention at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT. Economists predict a reading of 7.3 in June versus 1.6 in May for the survey of business conditions in the Philadelphia area. The Philadelphia Fed's survey is valuable because it offers an early glimpse of manufacturing activity in June, economists said. Other snapshots of June economic activity are provided by the Labor Department's weekly jobless claims and the weekly private surveys of chain store sales. Besides those items, the market must wait until the first week of July to get comprehensive reports on economic activity in June.   If the economic data are unsurprising or friendly, the market could trade higher on technical grounds, said analysts at MMS International. "Technicals suggest a favorable trade if the contract can hold support at 112-00," said one analyst. "Resistance is at 112-19 or 112-20." At 0800 EDT/1200 GMT, the benchmark 30-year bond was priced at 99-4/32, down 2/32, to yield 6.69 percent. Three-month Treasury bill rates were up one basis point to 4.94 percent. Six-month and year bill rates were unchanged at 5.07 percent and 5.33 percent, respectively.   Two-year notes were unchanged at 100-14/32, yielding six percent. The five-year note was down 1/32 to 100-28/32, yielding 6.29 percent. The 10-year note was down 2/32 to 101-21/32, yielding 6.40 percent. (( -- Ellen Freilich, N.A. Treasury Desk, 212-859-1679 ))
83167>>0>> Adam Opel AG, the German unit of U.S. carmaker General Motors Corp, said on Thursday its European car sales slipped in the first five months of the year and that it would be hard to keep up profit levels in 1997. Sales in Germany from January to May fell to 235,000 units from 266,600, which translated into a drop in market share to 15.5 percent from 16.7 percent in the 1996 five-month period. Opel's share of the west European vehicle market slumped during the five months to 11.8 percent from 12.6 percent in the year-ago period as new car registrations fell to 690,000 units from 724,000. Despite lower volume sales, Opel said its sales for the five-month period rose 400 million marks to 12.6 billion marks ($7.3 billion). Managing director David Herman said it would not be easy to match the 1996 net profit of 314 million marks in 1997, which was down 13 percent from 363 million marks in 1995. "We do not see for 1997 any growth impulses or a change in the competitive environment," he said at Opel's annual news conference, noting that overcapacity burdened European carmakers. The weak sales come at a critical time for Opel since it faces stiff criticism from its works council -- a consultative body for employees -- over GM's plans to use Opel to crack emerging markets in Latin America, eastern Europe and Asia. Two senior GM and Opel executives in Europe are reported to have quit in the last two weeks over scepticism about the plan. It calls for Opel to help build GM plants to raise GM's global production by more than 700,000 vehicles to about three million around the world by 2001. Many of the plants will produce Opel vehicles but will be operated by parent GM. Herman conceded that the expansion project had created some problems for Opel management, the scope of which was reflected in a recent internal survey of 300 top Opel executives that showed the project would endanger Opel's competitive position in Europe. "It is no question that the challenges facing management are unsually large," he said. "We see the problems from our expansion and are working with all efforts to find solutions." The works council of Opel demanded on Tuesday that the carmaker make clear its position on possible job cuts and boost investment in Germany to secure jobs. Opel responded on Thursday by saying it would raise 1997 domestic investment by about 50 percent to two billion marks and that it expected Opel vehicle deliveries to improve in the second half of 1997 based on current order levels. The carmaker also said it had set a goal of maintaining its 1996 market share for the year and for sales to reach a record of about 30 billion marks. "Our goal in Germany and Europe is to maintain our market share from last year," Herman said, noting he expected the German market to have about 3.5 million new vehicle sales. One factor weighing on profit would be the phase-out of the current top-selling Astra model during the rest of the year before the new model's launch in 1998, he said. Opel said it would also launch the largest product offensive in its history, offering 26 new models by the end of 2001 and six new models alone in 1998. The new models will include eight new small trucks and a new compact van, called the Zafira, that will be unveiled in September at the Frankfurt car show. Top areas for investment during the year will include Opel's Bochum plant where the new Astra, expected to be unveiled at the Frankfurt car show, will be produced. "These investments will improve efficiency and quality in manufacturing," Herman said, noting Opel had invested about seven billion marks in Germany in the last five years. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525 ($ = 1.731 German Marks)
83167>>0>> Germany's Adam Opel said on Thursday it was still in talks with its U.S. parent company General Motors over how to split the proceeds of its settlement with Volkswagen AG over allegations of industrial spying. Opel managing director David Herman told a news conference that the carmaker would receive "a substantially large portion" of the $100 million that VW paid to end GM's lawsuit over the allegations involving Jose Ignacio Lopez. Lopez was charged by public prosecutors in Germany with taking secret documents when he quit as a top GM executive to join rival Volkswagen in March 1993. Herman said the talks were still going on with GM officials in Detroit and did not say when a decision could be reached. The out-of-court settlement, reached last January, also called for VW to buy $1 billion worth of parts from GM over a seven-year period in return for GM dropping a racketeering and fraud lawsuit in a Detroit court. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Earl Pitts, a former FBI agent who sold U.S. national security documents to Moscow, was sentenced on Monday to 27 years in prison. The penalty for Pitts, a 13-year FBI veteran and counter-intelligence expert, was stiffer than federal prosecutors had sought. Even his own attorney said Pitts had made "horrible decisions" and committed "terrible actions." "What I did was wrong and harmful, pure and simple," Pitts said before sentencing in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington. He praised his former FBI colleagues, adding, "My actions, my crimes should not be used to diminish the efforts that they put forth." Standing before the judge in prison garb with the word "PRISONER" stenciled on the back, Pitts told federal Judge T.S. Ellis that he sold secrets to Soviet and then Russian officials out of "unreasonable anger that I felt." "You have much more reflection to do on that," Ellis responded, noting that Pitts had made no reference to money or betrayal of country in his statement of apology and remorse. "You certainly did it in part for simple greed." Ellis, who presided over more than three hours of legal debate before pronouncing sentence, made repeated mention of Pitts' abuse of trust as a counter-intelligence agent. "You betrayed your country, you betrayed your government, your fellow workers and all of us, really," Ellis said. "Every time you go by Arlington (National Cemetery) ... every name you see on the Vietnam Memorial ... you betrayed them especially." Pitts, now 44, was arrested on Dec. 18 for passing vital national security secrets to Russian intelligence agencies in exchange for $224,000 from 1987 to 1996, betraying some of the FBI's most sensitive operations. During Monday's hearing, federal prosecutors noted Pitts' willingness to betray his FBI colleagues, saying he offered his contacts such information as the number of children certain agents had and where they lived. Pitts, said to be motivated by money, was caught as a result of a 16-month undercover FBI sting and was dismissed by the agency in January. He had been in the FBI's New York City unit responsible for catching Russian spies. He was charged in a 12-count indictment with attempted espionage, conspiracy to commit espionage, communication of classified information and conveyance of government property without authorisation. Pitts pleaded guilty to the two most serious espionage charges. In exchange, prosecutors agreed to drop the remaining 10 charges. Pitts also agreed to cooperate.
83167>>0>> Thai stocks, which have been crawling at eight-year lows in past weeks, changed course on Monday and leapt by more than four percent on a technical rebound aided by foreign fund buying, brokers said. "It's not surprising that after so many dreadful days of falls the market should rise. It's basically a technical rebound," said Richard Henderson, head of research at Krung Thai Thanakit Plc. The index finished up 21.15 points to 501.40 at the lunch break. "I think today's gains represent a reallocation of funds to Thailand by investors with a long term, say two year, view of the market," said a trader at a Thai Military Bank affiliated brokerage. Other analysts cautioned that the rebound should not be viewed as the start of a pick up in battered Thai stock prices. More obstacles hung over the market, including political infighting in the ruling six-party coalition, and the side-effects of the country's worst economic slump in more than a decade. A technical analyst at the International Finance Institute in Bangkok said the stock index rebound over tough resistance at the 488-level was limited. "The rebound did not reach all lines. Only the main banks are really sought after so far. The move must extend to a majority of large caps today or it will mean that it will stop sooner than expected," he added. The unexpected surge followed the government's appointment of low-profile banker Thanong Bidaya on Friday to take charge of economic policy. His respected successor Amnuay Viravan had quit following intra-coalition government feuds. But Thanong's naming had little to do with the market's upward burst, brokers said. "I think the market is relatively neutral towards Thanong," said a trader at a broker affiliated to Thai Farmers bank. Thanong has said little about what he plans to do to lift Thailand from the economic crisis that has hit the troubled finance sector now overexposed to cash-strapped property firms. The new minister has pledged to sustain Amnuay's financial disciplines. Amnuay had ordered steep budget cuts and state-managed rescue packages for the ailing property and finance sectors to bail out the economy. On Monday, government officials said the embattled government planned to issue decrees outlining urgent measures to revamp the troubled finance and property sectors. The decrees would have contained details with guidelines for merging finance firms hit by liquidity crunches, outlining government roles in refinancing property loans extended by financial institutions and possibly measures to stamp out baht speculation. But a government minister said later on Monday that the Thai cabinet would delay the issue of the decrees because of some disagreement within government leaders on the exact nature of the planned measures.
83167>>0>> The head of Iran's judiciary Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi said on Tuesday jailed journalist Faraj Sarkuhi had been charged with espionage and would be tried soon, Iranian radio reported. "Sarkuhi was charged with espionage and an attempt to leave the country illegally and his trial will begin soon," the radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, quoted Yazdi as telling a news conference. It did not specify when the trial would be held. Sarkuhi, editor of the monthly Adineh (Friday), has alleged in a letter smuggled out of Iran that he was held for six weeks and tortured by the Iranian secret service in Tehran late last year to force him to confess to spying for Germany. In Paris, the League of Human Rights and the press freedom watchdog group Reporters sans Frontieres (Reporters without Borders - RSF) said Sarkuhi's trial had already begun and that he was being deprived of the right to a lawyer. RSF, citing Sarkuhi's brother Ismail as its source, said the trial began on Monday behind closed doors "somewhere in Tehran". Both organisations, in separate statements, expressed concern about Sarkuhi's fate, and RSF noted that espionage was punishable by death in Iran. The London-based human rights group Amnesty International said on Tuesday it believed Sarkuhi was a prisoner of conscience and was concerned about the trial. "We are deeply worried that Faraj Sarkuhi may not receive a fair trial and in fact risks facing the death penalty," Amnesty International said in a statement. Sarkuhi's wife, Farideh Zebarjad, who lives in Germany, has expressed concern that he is being held as a bargaining chip to put pressure on German authorities. A German court in April ruled that Iran's leadership ordered the killings of a group of Iranian Kurdish exiles in Berlin in 1992. Iran denied the charges. Germany downgraded relations with Tehran and, along with most EU members, recalled its ambassador for consultations after the court verdict. Germany's ambassador has still not returned. Sarkuhi was also one of six Iranian writers held briefly after security agents burst into a dinner function at the home of the German cultural attache in Tehran, Jens Gust, in July. Tehran later expressed regret over the incident after Bonn protested about the action in which the German news weekly Der Spiegel said the agents threatened Gust with violence, locked him in a room and interrogated him. In a 14-page handwritten letter published early this year by several German newspapers, which Bonn believes is genuine, Sarkuhi said he had been held by the Iranian secret service and forced under torture to confess in a taped interview that he had spied for Germany.

83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG and the IG Metall trade union said Wednesday they reached a comprehensive wage deal that gives the German carmaker a chance to cut its work force through an innovative early-retirement plan. VW and IG Metall, Germany's largest union, reached the deal late Tuesday. It calls for around 90,000 VW workers in west Germany to receive a 1.5 percent pay raise on Aug. 1 and another 2.5 percent raise in August 1998. The agreement also includes a pact for older workers at VW that IG Metall said was one of the first of its kind in Germany to deal with retirement issues. VW said the plan calls for workers to have the option of working part-time by receiving 85 percent of their net pay from the age of 55 to 57-1/2, while working the regular 28.8-hour four-day work week at VW. After reaching 57-1/2, workers will stop working but will still receive 85 percent of their net pay until the age of 60, when they would officially retire from the Wolfsburg-based carmaker. VW said the plan could affect about 10,000 people during the next five years at a cost to the carmaker of about 150,000 marks ($87,000) per worker. Klaus Zwickel, leader of the IG Metall metal and engineering sector trade union, called the plan an "excellent example of a socially acceptable deal between the generations." The programme, which is retroactive to the start of 1997, also calls for VW to make additional pension payments. This means there will be no great drop in pensions for workers who take part in the plan when they retire. The deal will help VW to cut its payroll without having to make dramatic job cuts as technology gains reduce the amount of time needed to produce vehicles and the number of workers required on assembly lines. VW is also in the midst of a global expansion programme under which it is building factories in lower-wage areas such as South America and Asia to grab a share of surging demand for new vehicles in emerging markets. A VW spokesman said the early retirement programme would also help allow VW to keep up to 1,000 trainees per year. The carmaker and IG Metall also agreed that workers would also receive a 500 mark ($290) bonus in 1997. Existing benefits for working on Saturdays will also remain but VW will have a chance to integrate Saturday shifts into the normal working routine. Three shifts could operate on Saturdays to help meet current strong demand for its cars and create new temporary jobs, VW negotiation leader Jochen Schumm said. The wage contract runs until the end of July 1999, while an agreement over job security issues runs to the end of 1999.

83167>>0>> France said on Thursday it was watching the trial in Iran of a journalist accused of espionage for signs of an improvement in Tehran's human rights record. "We are paying close attention to the fate of journalist Faraj Sarkuhi," Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said. "In a general manner, the question of human rights is one area where we are expecting a change from Iran," he said at the ministry's daily media briefing. The spokesman said France found initial statements by Iran's president-elect, former culture minister Mohammad Khatami, "encouraging." "We strongly hope they (the statements) will be followed by actions," Rummelhardt said. The head of Iran's judiciary Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi said on Tuesday that Sarkuhi had been charged with espionage and would be tried soon. Sarkuhi, editor of the monthly Adineh (Friday), has alleged in a letter smuggled out of Iran that he was held for six weeks and tortured by the Iranian secret service in Tehran late last year to force him to confess to spying for Germany. Human rights and press freedom groups have since said that the trial had begun and that Sarkuhi was being deprived of legal representation. The London-based human rights group Amnesty International said it believed Sarkuhi was a prisoner of conscience.
83167>>0>> Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended Friday.

83167>>0>> A U.S.-based human rights group urged Iran to release a newspaper editor arrested in April unless evidence was produced in a fair trial to support espionage charges against him. "We fear that the charges may have been brought  against Mr. Sarkuhi to punish him for his activities as a writer and to intimidate other independent-minded writers in Iran," Human Rights Watch wrote in an open letter to the head of Iran's judiciary Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi. The copy of the letter received by Reuters on Saturday was dated June 26. Faraj Sarkuhi, editor of the monthly Adineh (Friday), was arrested in April for trying to leave the country illegally. He had alleged in a letter smuggled out of Iran that he was held for six weeks and tortured by the Iranian secret service in Tehran late last year to force him to confess to spying to Germany. Yazdi on Tuesday said Sarkuhi had been charged with espionage and would be tried soon. Human rights and press freedom groups have since said that the trial had begun and that Sarkuhi was being deprived of legal representation. Sarkuhi's wife, Farideh Zebarjad, who lives in Germany, has expressed concern that her husband is being held as a bargaining chip to put pressure on Germany. A German court in April ruled that Iran's leadership ordered the killings of a group of Iranian Kurdish exiles in Berlin in 1992. Iran denied the charges. Germany downgraded relations with Tehran and, along with most EU members, recalled its ambassador for consultations after the verdict. Germany's ambassador has still not returned. "Human Rights Watch calls for Mr. Sarkuhi's immediate release, unless credible evidence is produced in a fair trial to support the serious charges against him," the letter said. "If he is to be tried, Human Rights Watch seeks your (Yazdi's) assurance that the trial will be open to the public and will comply with international law...," the letter added. The London-based human rights group Amnesty International said it believed Sarkuhi was a prisoner of conscience.
83167>>0>> Scores of people were missing, feared drowned, after a ferry capsized near Sandwip island in the Bay of Bengal during a rainstorm, police said on Saturday. They said the ferry with at least 150 people on board was overturned by strong winds 25 km (15 miles) from Chittagong port on Friday. "Although many of the passengers managed to swim ashore or were rescued by other vessels, some were still missing and may have drowned," one police officer said. In another incident, 10 Bangladeshis working for British Cairn Energy Plc, drilling for gas in the Bay of Bengal, were rescued after their boat sank on Friday, a Cairn official said. A helicopter from Cairn's drilling ship Ismaya rescued them some 45 km (30 miles) from Kutubdia Island. "There was a clear weather warning against movement of small craft in the Bay because of a persisting monsoon depression. But the boat ignored it," one meteorology official said. Maritime officials said they feared more boats might have sunk in strong winds and heavy rain since Friday. "The sea has been very rough forcing vessels to delay movements between the (Chittagong) port and the outer anchorage," Harbour Master Kamrul Islam said on Saturday. In Dhaka, heavy rain flooded many streets and disrupted businesses. A severe storm in May killed over 100 people and left over a million homeless on the Bangladesh coast and islands in the Bay.
83167>>0>> NEW YORK - U.S. blue-chip stocks rallied along with the bond market Friday on investors' growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates next week. The dollar rallied on new signs of economic weakness in Japan and further worries about Europe's planned single currency. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.47 points to close at 7,687.72.

83167>>0>> The International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday it welcomed the decision of the Thai authorities to float the baht and raise interest rates. An IMF statement said the IMF would respond rapidly to a Thai request for technical support to help implement these measures.   "The IMF welcomes today's important steps aimed at addressing Thailand's present economic difficulties and adopting a comprehensive strategy to ensure macroeconomic adjustment and financial stability," IMF acting managing director Stanley Fischer said. "The Thai authorities have requested technical assistance from the IMF for the effective implementation of these measures and the IMF will be responding rapidly to these requests," said Fischer, who is in charge of IMF operations while Managing Director Michel Camdessus is travelling. Thailand announced a managed float for the baht currency on Tuesday and raised the bank rate to 12.5 percent from 10.5 percent. The baht fell sharply on offshore markets, but the stock market jumped nearly eight percent on foreign buying. Analysts in Bangkok said the moves could help the Thai economy, which is grappling with slow growth and a troubled financial sector. --Washington newsroom ((202 898 8309))
83167>>0>> A Moscow court has sentenced a former Russian diplomat to seven years hard labour for spying for the United States over a period of more than two decades, Itar-Tass news agency said on Thursday. It said Vasily Makarov was recruited by Washington's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1976 in Bolivia. Tass said he was found guilty of espionage at a trial last month but the details have only just been made public. The news came a day after another Russian was jailed for 10 years for spying for Britain. After his recruitment, Makarov worked for the CIA until his return to Moscow in 1979 and then again in Spain from 1989, Tass said. Makarov, who was born in 1945, received more than $20,000 for his espionage work, it said. Tass said the court's sentence, meted out on June 19, was relatively mild because of Makarov's "candid repentance, his full acceptance of his guilt and his active cooperation with the investigation". The court could not be reached for details. The U.S. embassy in Moscow was also not available for comment. On Wednesday, Russia's Supreme Court sentenced one-time Russian company manager Vadim Sintsov to 10 years hard labour after he pleaded guilty to providing British agents with information on the Russian arms industry. Sintsov also received a lighter sentence than the maximum 20 years for "cooperating with the court". Tass said Makarov's trial had been the shortest of this year's espionage cases so far and had lasted just four days. The trial was held behind closed doors and Tass did not say what secrets Makarov had divulged. Russian security officials have recently warned that foreign spy services are stepping up their operations in the country, despite the end of the Cold War. Senior officials from the FSB federal security service, successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said that in 1996 alone they uncovered 27 professional foreign spies and 60 Russian citizens working for foreign intelligence services. A former Russian Foreign Ministry worker, Platon Obukhov, arrested last year on charges of spying for the British, is still awaiting trial. Obukhov's family says the young man, who held a technical position in a crucial ministry department, was mentally unstable and should be treated by doctors rather then prosecuted. Last month, FSB chief Nikolai Kovalyov called on foreign spies and their Russian operatives to call a hotline and become double agents. Kovalyov said last week the hotline had been a success and added, tantalisingly, that people would be surprised when he gave details. Washington says Moscow is still active as well. An official at the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said earlier this year it was still investigating about 200 espionage cases and that resources spent on catching spies in Washington had increased since the Soviet Union's collapse. Last month Harold Nicholson became the highest-ranking CIA officer ever indicted on espionage charges. He was sentenced to more than 23 years for spying for Russia since mid-1994.
83167>>0>> British writers gathered outside the Iranian embassy in London on Monday, calling for the release of jailed newspaper editor Faraj Sarkuhi. Around 40 demonstrators, including authors Rachel Billington and Richard Holroyd, waved banners demanding the Iranian authorities free Sarkuhi, who was arrested in April trying to leave Iran illegally. The only reaction from the embassy was to turn security cameras towards the group. Organised by PEN, an international club for writers, the protest was the latest in a long campaign of weekly demonstrations and open letters to the Tehran government. Concern has been mounting among human rights groups since Iran said Sarkuhi was to be tried for espionage. As rumours swirled over Sarkuhi's whereabouts, PEN said it believed an additional charge of adultery has now been laid. Both espionage and adultery are punishable by death in Iran. Some campaigners said they were optimistic Sarkuhi may be spared under Iran's new President Khatemi who committed himself to freedom of expression and human rights in his election campaign. "We're hoping President Khatami will be more lenient," said PEN chairman Morris Farhi. "If Sarkuhi is still alive, this may be an indication of Khatami's good intentions. However PEN's president, Josephine Pullein-Thompson said she believed Islamic fundamentalists in Iran would still have the final say. Sarkuhi was editor of the monthly Adineh (Friday) newspaper before disappearing last November. His wife, who lives in Germany with their two children, said earlier this year she feared he was being held as a bargaining chip after Germany accused Iran of being behind the 1992 killing of four Kurdish dissidents in Berlin. A letter allegedly written by Sarkuhi says he was held for six weeks by the Iranian secret service and forced under torture to confess to spying for Germany.
83167>>0>> Croatia's central bank said on Wednesday there was no economic reason for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to delay discussion about the next tranche of a $486 million credit to Croatia. The fund was expected by now to approve the second tranche of the extended fund facility (EFF), issued in March under a three-year programme of support to Croatia's reforms. "The move of the IMF's board of directors is unusual and from the economic point of view inexplicable, particularly since the first review... in May confirmed Croatia was implementing the agreed policies," the bank said in a statement faxed to Reuters. "In other words, there were no obstacles to continuing with success an exceptionally correct cooperation of this international financial institution with our country," it said. Although the IMF's expert bodies and most of its executive directors were said to have given a green light for the second tranche, its board postponed discussion until the end of July. But the bank said the delay would have no economic consequences since the funds were aimed to strengthen its already solid foreign currency reserves. Croatia was supposed to draw on a total of $158 million this year. "This decision (by the IMF) will by no means spur any changes of Croatia's monetary and economic policy... We believ that the IMF and World Bank will soon be able to resume their support...," the bank added. The World Bank under U.S. pressure last month also put off indefinitely $30 million in technical support intended for helping private investments in Croatia. The Croatian government condemned the decision it described as a tool of political pressure on the country. -- Kolumbina Bencevic, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075
83167>>0>> A federal grand jury Thursday indicted three Taiwanese nationals, including two employees of a major paper company in Taiwan, on charges of attempting to steal trade secrets from drugs maker Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. An investigation was continuing into whether the paper company, a subsidiary of Yuen Foong Yu Paper Manufacturing Co Ltd., was itself involved in the alleged attempt to steal technology to make the anti-cancer drug Taxol, authorities told a news conference. The paper company has previously denied any involvement in the case, which orginated with an FBI sting operation centered on an undercover firm the agency billed as a "technological information broker." There has been no indication of Taiwanese government involvement in the alleged crime, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Levy said. The case was the second brought under 1996 U.S. law against economic trade espionage, and illustrates a new-style international espionage in which trade secrets are the goal, Bob Reutter, special agent in charge of the Philadelphia FBI office, told reporters. "With the end of the cold war, espionage is no longer about stealing atomic secrets or military secrets," Reutter said. "Espionage today is becoming stealing economic strength." Bristol-Myers sold $800 million worth of Taxol in 1996, he said. "I don't need to tell you how significant the trade secrets and the technology associated with them would be to Bristol-Myers Squibb," he said. Two of those indicted, Kai-Lo Hsu and Charles Ho, were arrested last month and were released on $1 million bail each to detention in their homes in the United States. Authorities have issued a warrant for the arrest of the third indicted person, Jessica Chou, who is believed to be in Taiwan, which lacks an extradition treaty with the United States. Legal documents described Hsu as technical director of the Yuen Foong Paper Co Ltd, in Taipei, and Chou as manager of business development at the firm, which is a subsidiary of Yuen Foong. Ho was described as a professor at the National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan and director of a biotechnology innovation center there. The FBI established the undercover firm in 1994. The agency wanted to investigate possible economic espionage, but did not have the Taiwan firm as a target, Reutter said. The undercover company is no longer in operation, he said. The indictment says Chou approached the unidentified undercover firm in 1995, and later asked for information about the manufacture of Taxol, a drug used to fight ovarian cancer. At a February 1996 meeting in Los Angeles, Hsu told the undercover agent his company wanted to diversify into biotechnology using imported technology, according to the indictment. When told Bristol-Myers would probably object to selling the information, Hsu allegedly replied "we'll get another way," and asked the agent to try to find a Bristol-Myers employee willing to sell the information. Hsu and Chou allegedly agreed to initially pay $400,000 for the Taxol technology, the indictment said. Hsu and Ho were arrested after a June 14 meeting in Philadelphia in which they discussed the deal with a person posing as a corrupt Bristol-Myers employee. After the arrests in June, a spokesman for Yuen Foong called the allegations "completely groundless and untrue." The spokesman said the company had been approached by a U.S. investment consulting firm, Mano Associates, to discuss possible technology cooperation. Bristol-Myers did not immediately retun a call seeking comment on the case. All three of those indicted were charged with attempted theft of trade secrets and conspiracy to commit commercial bribery as well as various related offenses. Levy said Hsu faces a maximum penalty of 60 years in prison and a $2.5 million fine if convicted, Ho faces a total of 30 years and a $1 million fine and Chou faces 55 years and a $2.25 million fine.
83167>>0>> Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Friday. LONDON - Shares closed higher for a third straight session, as a continuing robust performance on Wall Street helped drag the FTSE 100 index of blue chip stocks within striking distance of its record high. The FTSE 100 closed at 4,799.5, up 31.7 points, or 0.66 percent. There was a fall of 13.3 points from last week. FRANKFURT - Germany's IBIS DAX ended computer dealings at a fresh record high of 4,074.30 points, up 73.65 points, or 1.84 percent, as the market found renewed hope from Wall Street gains and the dollar trading at 71-month highs against the mark. In earlier trade the DAX-30 index closed at 4,040.97, up 48.59 points, or 1.22 percent, giving a rise of 98.44 on the week. PARIS - Shares ended firmer, benefiting from dollar strength, traders said. Volume was fairly thin ahead the long weekend with markets closed on Monday for the national July 14 holiday. The CAC-40 index closed at 2,941.59, up 12.50 points, or 0.43 percent and rising 7.11 points from last week. ZURICH - Shares ended more than one percent lower, extending the correction which started on Thursday after a string of record highs, dealers said. The Swiss market index closed at 5,801.5, down 83.9 points, or 1.43 percent on the day and down 45 points on the week. MILAN - Shares closed at a new record high, lifted by a strong showing at the opening on Wall Street and lira strength against the mark and a revival of interest in giant insurer Generali. The All Share Mibtel index closed at 14,018, up 190 points, or 1.37 percent, up 410 points on the week. AMSTERDAM - Shares rallied to fresh highs, with both main share indices setting a record close as market players revelled in a row of positive factors. The AEX index closed at 936.51, up 11.80 points, or 1.28 percent. There was a rise of 29.32 from last week. TOKYO - Stocks closed moderately higher, as lingering worries over the financial health of some companies prompted investors to actively seek high-technology issues that are backed by strong earnings, brokers said. The 225-share Nikkei average closed at 19,875.49, up 120.71 points, or 0.61 percent. This was down 92.51 from last Friday. HONG KONG - Stocks closed stronger as a technical rebound pushed up the blue chip Hang Seng Index by 386.06 points, or 2.60 percent, to 15,225.29, for a rise of 402.32 points on the week. "This is a technical rebound since the market has been oversold on the daily chart," said Calvin Chan, technical analyst at J&A securities. SYDNEY - Shares closed slightly firmer, with gold stocks rebounding after this week's heavy sell-off. But the market finished the week weaker due to the precious metal's continuing woes. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,699.1, up 4.7 points, or 0.17 percent but showed a fall of 34.30 from the previous Friday's close. JOHANNESBURG - Shares put a quiet end to a topsy-turvy week as they finished a healthy trading session with their heads just above opening levels, dealers said.

This was up 4.7 from last Friday.
83167>>0>> Technical analysis suggests the spread between 10-year Italian and German government bond yields has crashed through key support levels and will shrink rapidly in the near term, chartists said on Monday. "The BTP/Bund spread has continued its very sharp narrowing trend, and we have broken through some significant levels in the last week," said Ian Stannard, technical analyst at Chase in London. "We are targeting 76 basis points over the next couple of weeks." The BTP/Bund spread has swung in at a furious rate, from 155 basis points in early June to 91 basis points on Monday. The breakthrough has been on the back of a growing belief that Italy will join the European single currency with the first wave of entrants in 1999, economists said. But technical analysts find the BTP/Bund spread charts offer at least as strong an argument for the spread to come in further. "We have broken down out of channel support on daily closing charts," said Elizabeth Miller, technical analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London. Parallel trendlines drawn from the 222 basis point peak in the BTP/Bund spread, reached in mid-March, throw up a key technical level at around 98 basis points. "We have broken through that, and it has now become resistance," said Stannard. Miller at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, like Stannard, found the next key support well below current levels . "We are moving down towards 73 basis points, which is an Elliott wave swing target." Elliott wave theory holds that a market follows a repetitive pattern consisting of five waves one way followed by a three wave correction. Technical indicators also suggest the spread is destined for further narrowing, analysts said. "The RSI has broken through support at 27.00, and is currently around 25.00 percent," said Stannard. RSI, Relative Strength Index, is used to identify when an instrument is overbought or oversold. A reading below 30 percent suggests an oversold instrument. If the spread does widen, it will meet resistance at 98-100 basis points, where a trendline and psychological resistance coincide, analysts said. Beyond there, Miller found further resistance at 115 basis points. But the trend is towards a spread tightening, with 50 basis points in view in the medium term, Miller added. "That tallies with what the economists are saying," she said. Ken Wattret, international economist at Paribas Capital Markets in London, also said he forecast a 50 basis point BTP/Bund spread by the end of the year, based on the assumption Italy will join European economic and monetary union (EMU) promptly. But an immediate 15-basis point tightening in the spread was less likely, Wattret added. "I am struggling to come up with fundamental reasons why the spread should narrow significantly in the short term. "The market needs momentum -- that momentum might come in the form of technical factors." -- International Bonds Unit, +44 171 542 6320
83167>>0>> Thailand said on Monday it would not rule out seeking financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help it solve its current economic problems. "At the moment, the assistance we have from the IMF is purely technical. However, we do not rule out financial assistance from the IMF. The Bank of Thailand is looking at every avenue possible and it is up to them to make a decision," finance ministry secretary general Chatumongkol Sonakul told reporters.   Thailand is going though its worst economic slump in more than a decade with major troubles in its depressed and cash-strapped financial and property sectors. The government on July 2 floated the baht, which had been pegged for 13 years to a trade-weighted basket of currencies dominated by the dollar. This has led to local worries about rising inflation and concerns about the debt exposure of local firms with unhedged loans.   Former finance minister Amnuay Viravan, who quit last month over differences with his cabinet colleagues on how to solve Thailand's economic woes, has opposed borrowing from the IMF. He said the government should instead adopt a proper economic recovery plan.
83167>>0>> Two more bodies have been found in a scenic lake in Indonesia's North Sumatra province where an overloaded ferry sank on Sunday night, pushing the death toll to 77, the official Antara news agency reported on Tuesday. "Two more bodies, which are the victims of K.M. Pedaltari have been found by the rescue officials," said Antara. The agency earlier said as many as 100 people could have died in the accident on lake Toba when the ferry capsized on its way from Parapat on the shore of the lake to Tomok on the island of Samosir, which is on the middle of the lake. Rescue officials said more than 150 people were believed to have been on the wooden ferry, which had a maximum legal capacity of between 50 and 60 people, said Antara. It said the ferry's captain Opo Sihotang was among the missing, either because he had drowned or had run away. Police in Medan, the capital of North Sumatra, earlier said the death toll could increase as the search continued. They said passengers were returning to their hometowns after attending an annual cultural festival in Parapat. No foreigners were among the passengers, police said. Antara quoted survivors as saying they heard loud cracking noises before the ferry sank and that water quickly flooded into the boat.
83167>>0>> At least 70 people have been confirmed dead after a ferry capsized on Indonesia's scenic Lake Toba in North Sumatra, the official Antara news agency reported on Tuesday. "Seventy bodies have been found as of 11:45 a.m.  (0445 GMT). They are the victims from the K.M. Peldatari which sank on Sunday night," the agency reported. Police had earlier said 60 people died in the accident in the popular tourist destination in the inland mountain range which runs the length of Sumatra island. Antara said 50 people had been rescued from the ferry, which sank on its way from Parapat on the shore of Lake Toba to Tomok on Samosir island in the middle of the lake. It said more than 150 people were believed to have been on the ferry, which had a maximum legal capacity of between 50 and 60 people. Police in Medan, the capital of North Sumatra, later said the death toll might increase as the search continued. "We have the names of 60 people who are killed in the accident. Most of them are villagers who returned to their hometowns after attending a festival in Parapat," one policeman told Reuters. "What we know is there are no foreigners among the passengers," he said. Antara said the passengers were returning to the island after attending the annual local cultural festival. It quoted survivors as saying they heard loud cracking noises before the boat sank. "Water quickly came into the boat, so the passengers who were mostly teenagers jumped into the lake, which is 800 metres (2,600 feet) deep," the agency said.
83167>>0>> At least 60 people died after a ferry carrying 200 passengers sank in lake Toba, a tourist resort in Indonesia's north Sumatra province, police said on Tuesday. "The latest information we have this morning shows that 60 people died in the accident on Sunday night. There could be more victims as the search continues," a policeman in Tarutung town told Reuters by telephone. Earlier reports said the accident was on Monday night. "The boat, K.M. Peldatari, carried at least 200 people, which is far above its limit of between 50 and 60 passengers," the policeman said. He said the wooden vessel sank on its way from Parapat on the shore of lake Toba to Tomok on Samosir island, which is in the middle of the lake. He declined to give further details and it was not known if there were any foreigners among the passengers. The official Antara news agency reported on Tuesday the passengers were returning to the island after attending an annual local cultural festival in Parapat. The agency quoted survivors as saying they heard loud cracking noises before the boat sank. "Water quickly came into the boat, so the passengers who were mostly teenagers jumped into the lake, which is 800 metres (2,600 feet) deep," the agency said.
83167>>0>> The death toll from a capsized ferry on Indonesia's scenic Lake Toba in North Sumatra rose to 82 after rescue officials found four more bodies, the official Antara news Agency reported on Wednesday. "The search and rescue team found another four bodies on Wednesday morning," Antara said. The ferry K.M. Pedaltari capsized on Sunday. Antara said rescue officials continued their search as 108 people had been recorded as missing. Rescue officials said more than 150 people were believed to have been on the small wooden ferry, which had a maximum legal capacity of between 50 and 60 people. It said the ferry's captain, Opo Sihotang, was among the missing people, either because he had drowned or had fled. Antara quoted a member of an amateur radio organisation as saying about 50 passengers had swum to safety. The Kompas daily said villages in the Lake Toba region were in mourning, with red flags flying as a sign that somebody had died. Police said the passengers were returning to their homes on Samosir Island after attending a cultural festival in Parapat on the shore of the lake. No foreigners were among the passengers, police said. Antara quoted survivors as saying they heard loud cracking noises before the boat sank and that water quickly flooded into the boat.
83167>>0>> A Swiss diplomat accused of selling secrets to Romanian intelligence has confessed to espionage after he was arrested earlier this month, the federal prosecutor's office in Berne said on Wednesday. Swiss authorities took the official, whose identity was not revealed, into custody on July 1 on suspicion of espionage and violating official secrecy. He remains in investigative custody, prosecutor's spokesman Peter Lehmann said. "The official has confessed," he added. The diplomat is accused of handing over secret political and economic assessments to Romanian intelligence as well as information about people wanted by police. He was given cash and other material goods for his services, Lehmann said.
83167>>0>> Romania on Thursday denied involvement in espionage against Switzerland after Berne said it had arrested a Swiss diplomat accused of spying for the former communist country. "The (Romanian) Foreign Intelligence Service (SIE) has not conducted and is not conducting any espionage activities against Switzerland," the SIE director, General Ioan Talpes, was quoted by the local news agency Mediafax as saying. SIE is one of a dozen Romanian spy agencies created after the 1989 fall of communism in the Balkan country. Its spy-catching counterpart, the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI), which replaced the dreaded Communist-era Securitate secret police, is the only intelligence body subordinated to parliament control. Berne prosecutors said on Wednesday they had taken a Swiss diplomat into custody over accusations of handing over secret political and economic assessments to Romanian intelligence as well as information about people wanted by police. The Swiss federal prosecutor's office said the diplomat had confessed to espionage. Asked to comment on the diplomat's case, an official at the Romanian SRI's press office told Reuters: "The SRI has no links with foreign espionage, and even less so with spying against a friendly country."

83167>>0>> Romania has offered to help clear up a potentially damaging spy scandal involving Switzerland, the Foreign Ministry said on Friday. It has asked Berne for details of the case of a Swiss diplomat arrested over accusations of spying for the former communist country. "Romania's image and international prestige have been marred by its supposed involvement in a case of spying against a friendly country," a ministry statement said. On Wednesday, Berne prosecutors said they had taken a Swiss diplomat into custody over accusations of handing over secret political and economic data to Romanian intelligence as well as information about people wanted by police. The Swiss federal prosecutor's office said the diplomat had confessed to espionage. On Thursday, Romania's top spy agencies -- the Foreign Intelligence Service (SIE) and spy-catchers Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI) -- denied involvement in the case. The SRI, which replaced the dreaded Communist-era Securitate secret police, is the only intelligence body subject to parliamentary control, from a dozen intelligence units created in Romania after thre 1989 fall of communism. The ruling centrists, who ended seven years of leftist administration at last year's presidential and parliamentary elections, have vowed to step up efforts to bring the country's intelligence bodies under full democratic control. The Swiss diplomat's arrest follows another embarrassing incident last year, when Berne recalled its ambassador to Bucharest for an official probe into accusations that his Romanian lover was a spy.
83167>>0>> The lawyer for an Israeli man charged with spying in Egypt said on Saturday that the real motive in the case was to stop the normalisation of Egyptian-Israeli relations. "Is there really an espionage case? The case is meant to stop normalisation," Farid el-Deeb, lawyer for Israeli Druze textile engineer Azam Azam, said during a session of his trial. Azam and Egyptian worker Emad Abdelhalim Ismail are charged with making criminal arrangements to spy in Egypt for Israel's secret service, Mossad. They have pleaded not guilty. Two women -- Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna -- are on trial in absentia for the same charges. The case, which began on April 24, brought Egypt-Israeli ties to one of their lowest ebbs since their 1979 peace treaty. Relations have also been strained since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took power in 1996 and the peace process stalled between Palestinians and Israelis. "The unfair (Egyptian) media campaign regarded Azam as a symbol," Deeb said in a two-hour speech in which he called on Netanyahu to "refrain from militancy and arbitrariness...and let the peace process progress". The two defendants, handcuffed to policemen, stood silently in a courtroom cage during the State Security Court trial, which will resume on Sunday. According to investigators, Azam is alleged to have given Ismail women's underwear marked with Mossad's invisible ink to take into Egypt. Published accounts of Ismail's confession say he was blackmailed into working for Mossad by explicit pictures of his love affair with Greiss and that Shawahna offered him $1,000 to work for Israeli intelligence. Originally the two men were charged with economic spying. In May, state prosecutors introduced a criminal espionage charge, saying Azam made a criminal agreement with Ismail and the two Israeli women to spy for Mossad. Deeb on Saturday rejected the new charge because the case had already opened. He also questioned procedures of the investigation. "Reports of Emad's interrogations do not say when they ended. And two men, Mickey Baghoth and Maher el-Nemr, were named in the reports as Mossad agents. Why were they not included like Mona and Zahra?" Deeb said Ismail's confession contained only details of his affairs. He objected that the authority which arrested Emad and Azam also carried out tests and checked the suspected material. "I myself bought invisible ink for one Egyptian pound. It is available on the market," Deeb said. It is not clear what the maximum penalty is for the men. Deeb has said his client faced a maximum 15 years in prison with hard labour while Ismail could be given a life sentence because he was a civil servant. Ahmed Bakr, Ismail's lawyer, has said both faced a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Asaad Asaad, a prominent Druze figure and Netanyahu adviser, and Israel's consul in Cairo, Eli Levy, attended the session.
83167>>0>> At least 13 people were drowned when a small Indonesian ferry said to be carrying more than twice its maximum load sank off the island of South Sulawesi, the Jakarta Post reported on Monday. The newspaper said 11 people were injured, five seriously, when the nine metre (30 foot) long Sumber Jaya ferry sank on Sunday at the mouth of the Pangkajene river, about 60 km (40 miles) north of the South Sulawesi provincial capital of Ujung Pandang. It quoted local police chief Lieutenant-Colonel Haryogo as saying the accident was probably caused by overloading. "The ship's capacity was only 20 to 25 people," he said. The Jakarta Post estimated the Sumber Jaya was carrying 50 passengers at the time of the accident. A number of people are still missing, it added. Survivors said the boat ran into rough waters while travelling from Laiya island to the town of Pangkep. The incident was the latest in a string of accidents raising concerns about the safety of public transport in Indonesia. Last week an overloaded ferry capsized on Lake Toba in North Sumatra, drowning at least 82 people, and a Fokker F-27 aircraft crashed near Bandung, killing 30 passengers and crew.
83167>>0>> German carmaker Volkswagen AG said on Tuesday that vehicle sales in the first half of 1997 rose 9.8 percent to 2.194 million vehicles. In western Europe, VW said its group vehicles sales rose four percent to 1.291 million vehicles. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Seven people including two children drowned on Wednesday when their car sank while crossing a small river in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, Russian news agencies said. The agencies quoted Emergencies Ministry officials as saying the off-road vehicle carrying nine people across the river Pshish fell into an underwater ditch and immediately sank. Two people were rescued.
83167>>0>> More than 40 people missing after a ferry sank in Bangladesh's flooded Jamuna river were believed drowned, police said on Wednesday. Rescuers retrieved seven bodies and 116 people were rescued by nearby boats after the ferry sank on Tuesday in a whirlpool near Sariakandi town in the northern district of Bogra. Searches by police and villagers for the missing on Wednesday proved futile. "We are almost certain that by now all the missing passengers including women and children are dead," police superintendent Shahadat Hossain told reporters in Bogra. "Even very strong, young people would find it difficult to survive so long in such a fiercely flowing river," he said. Divers from Dhaka who joined the rescue effort  told officials at Sariakandi that they found no bodies around the accident site. "The bodies may have been swept far downstream of the river by strong currents," one diver said. Reporters in Bogra said earlier the death toll could be more than 50 because no one seemed to know the precise number of passengers. Last month more than 50 people drowned when a ferry capsized in Bangladesh's Dhanu river, northeast of Dhaka. Flooding this month has killed more than 100 people in Bangladesh.
83167>>0>> The head of Romania's Foreign Intelligence Service (SIE) has resigned over a spy scandal involving Switzerland, President Emil Constantinescu's press office said on Thursday. General Ioan Talpes tendered his resignation to Constantinescu, taking the blame for the case of a Swiss diplomat arrested by Berne over accusations of spying for Romania, a statement said. Romania's top spy agencies -- the SIE and the domestic spy-catchers, the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI) -- had both denied involvement in the case of the diplomat. The Berne federal prosecutor's office said the diplomat had confessed to espionage. Constantinescu had summoned Talpes to submit a full report on the Swiss spy case, the presidency statement said. "The SIE has not and is not spying on Switzerland," it said, quoting excerpts from an SIE report. But the report admitted that "there were sporadic contacts over several years between a Swiss diplomat and SIE collaborators". It did not name the Swiss diplomat but said he had "offered unclassified documents, which were not detrimental to Switzerland's interests or security." Last week, Berne prosecutors said they took a Swiss diplomat into custody over accusations he handed secret political and economic data to Romanian intelligence, as well as information about people wanted by police. Talpes offered to quit "considering that this case might compromise Romanian-Swiss relations and because I deem myself the sole person responsible for this situation", the presidency quoted him as saying. The statement quoted Constantinescu as saying the SIE chief's resignation was "in keeping with the code of military honour". Constantinescu has yet to appoint a successor to Talpes, the second major spymaster to quit this year. The head of the SRI, Virgil Magureanu, quit earlier this year after serving since the body's inception in March 1990 to replace Romania's dreaded Communist-era secret police, the Securitate. Constantinescu and centrists who ended seven years of leftist administration in last November's elections have vowed to bring the Balkan country's intelligence community under full democratic control. The United States and the European Union have encouraged Romania's leadership to rid the country of remnants of the Securitate believed to have remained in top intelligence posts. The SRI is the only intelligence body subject to parliamentary control out of a dozen intelligence units operating in Romania since the 1989 fall of communism. A top SRI official was removed this week, within days of being appointed to head operations in western Romania, after Romanian newspapers linked him to Securitate excesses. The Swiss diplomat's arrest followed an embarrassing incident last year when Berne recalled its ambassador to Romania for an inquiry into accusations that his Romanian lover was a spy.
83167>>0>> Rescue workers pulled five bodies from Bangladesh's flooded Jamuna river on Thursday, raising the death from a recent ferry accident to 12, police said. But at least 50 people were still missing and presumed drowned since a ferry sank late Tuesday in a whirlpool near Sariakandi town in the northern district of Bogra, police said. The official BSS news agency in Dhaka on Thursday put the number missing at more than 100. At least 116 people were rescued immediately after the accident, the police said. Searches were continuing, BBS reported.
83167>>0>> Japanese police have issued an arrest warrant for a Russian who posed as a Japanese national for the last 30 years in order to spy, Japanese news reports said on Tuesday. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police issued the warrant for the Russian, who is described as being of Asian descent, according to Japan's Tokyo Broadcasting System and the national Kyodo news service. The police are asking that an international arrest warrant be issued as well, the reports said. The suspect was alleged to have conducted political, economic and military espionage for more than 30 years for the former Soviet Union and then Russia, the reports said. Kyodo quoted officials of the Metropolitan Police Department's Public Security Bureau as saying a Russian Embassy secretary who recently left Japan was involved in the scheme. Police and Russian embassy officials were not available for comment on the reports. The suspect, who worked at a Tokyo trading company, has been missing since he left for Beijing two years ago, TBS said in its report. The report did not explain why the case was now coming to light. The suspect was wanted on suspicion of applying five years ago for a passport in the name of Ichiro Kuroba, a 67-year-old man who has been reported missing, TBS reported. The reports said the suspect's house contained  espionage equipment such as wireless receivers and tables to decipher cryptograms.
83167>>0>> Russian spycatchers have identified 1,200 foreign spies or foreigners suspected of spying in the past three years, Interfax news agency quoted a senior counter-intelligence official as saying on Wednesday. The unnamed official told Interfax that in the same period 130 illegal operations by foreign secret services had been disclosed and 52 foreign spies had been expelled. He also said 46 Russian citizens who cooperated with foreign intelligence services had been detected and arrested. A spokesman for Russia's Federal Security Service, which leads the country's fight against espionage, declined to comment on the report. The official quoted by Interfax hailed as a huge counter-intelligence success the arrest in early 1996 of a junior foreign ministry official, Platon Obukhov, who faces charges of spying for Britain's MI6 foreign intelligence. "Obukhov's arrest has been the biggest failure of MI6 since Oleg Penkovsky," he said referring to a Soviet colonel executed in 1963 for passing secrets to Britain through businessman Greville Wynne. The official said that following Obukhov's arrest 14 MI6 officers had been disclosed and forced to leave Russia. "The MI6 has been actually forced to stop its active work in Russia," he added. Earlier on Wednesday Russian judges ruled that Obukhov, 28, was mentally unstable and needed psychiatric treatment. They decided to return to his case when he feels better. Obukhov's lawyer and parents insist that he has been mentally unstable since childhood, including the period when he is said to had spied for Britain. They insist that all charges against him be dropped. The prosecution says he was sane when dealing with the British agents and should sooner or later answer for high treason in court. The counter-intelligence official told Interfax that a senior officer of the Mossad Israeli intelligence service had been seized red-handed in Moscow when trying to receive materials from an agent and expelled. "For the time being Mossad activities in Russia have been halted," the official said. Russian counter-intelligence officials have said that MI6 and Mossad were the best-run spy agencies they had to deal with even though they were far smaller that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Earlier this year two Russians were tried in court and found guilty of spying for Britain and the United States. The official told Interfax that more spy stories were still ahead. "A number of operations involving foreign citizens who are spying against Russia are under way now," he said. "But it is too early to name the names." Russian counter-intelligence officials have said that foreign secret services have stepped up their activities in Russia after the euphoria of the West's honeymoon with the post-Soviet Kremlin started fading. Last month counter-intelligence chief Nikolai Kovalyov set up a telephone number inviting all Russians working for foreign spy agencies to call and confess in exchange for a promise that they would not be charged. Kovalyov later said that the hot line was a huge success but gave no details.
83167>>0>> President Emil Constantinescu on Wednesday appointed a close aide with little apparent experience in intelligence work to head Romania's foreign spy agency (SIE), whose chief resigned over a scandal. A statement from the presidential press office said Catalin Harnagea, 39, an economic and local administration adviser to the president, had been named agency director. Last week, General Ioan Talpes resigned as head of the SIE, the Foreign Intellgience Service, taking the blame for the case of a Swiss diplomat arrested by Berne over accusations of spying for Romania. The statement described Harnagea as an engineer by training who had been a journalist for a major Bucharest daily. He became an adviser to Constantinescu a month after he ousted ex-communist Ion Iliescu in presidential elections. It said Harnagea graduated from the National Defence College in July 1997 after presenting a thesis on "Crisis management and the secret services." Since Constantinescu and his centrist allies won last year's elections, they have pledged to bring the Balkan country's intelligence services under full democratic control. The United States and the European Union have suggested remnants of the Communist-era Securitate secret police have remained in intelligence bodies and encouraged Romania's leadership to clear them out. The presidential statement said Harnagea was not a member of any political party. But he served as campaign manager for Victor Ciorbea, now Constantinescu's prime minister, when he ran for mayor of Bucharest last year. Earlier this year,  Constantinescu named Costin Georgescu, the man who ran his own presidential campaign last year, to head the SRI, Romania's counter-intelligence service. The SRI is the only intelligence body subject to parliamentary control out of a dozen services operating in Romania since the 1989 fall of communism. Talpes stepped down after Swiss prosecutors said they had detained a diplomat over accusations he handed secret political and economic data to Romanian intelligence, as well as information about people wanted by police. Both the SRI and SIE denied conducting intelligence activities against Switzerland. But the SIE admitted in a report that "there were sporadic contacts over several years between a Swiss diplomat and SIE collaborators."
83167>>0>> Volkswagen AG, the largest carmaker in  Europe, will finally join the big leagues of sports sponsorship on  Saturday when their hometown team of Wolfsburg plays its first match  in Germany's first-division Bundesliga. But don't look for the VW insignia to be soon adorning the jerseys  of top-name European soccer teams -- as does the logo of many VW rivals,  notably Adam Opel AG which has major sponsorship deals with Bayern  Munich and Italy's AC Milan. "This is a backyard sponsorship deal that has turned out to be incredibly  productive," said Klaus Kocks, a Volkswagen management board member  in charge of corporate communications. "It's a way to show our commitment to Wolfsburg area but it will not  be part of our marketing strategy," Kocks said. The VW logo will remain on the front of the team's green and white  jerseys at an estimated cost of three million marks, money that comes  out of VW's human resources department and not from marketing funds,  according to VW officials. Despite Wolfsburg's promotion into the first division, a mega market  where sponsors offer teams millions of marks to have their logo on  jerseys, VW has put up the additional money to keep on supporting  the team as it has done for decades. "It would have been unthinkable for us to go into the first division  without Volkswagen as our top sponsor," said Wolfgang Heitman, managment  board chairman of the Wolfsburg club and owner of three VW dealerships  in the Wolfsburg region. The Wolfsburg team suffered years of mediocrity in local leagues before  making an assault on the top league in the mid-1980s. The efforts  proved fruitful last season when the team was promoted to the first  division for the first time. The German carmaker instead will stick to its strategy of sponsoring  up-and-coming music groups as well as cultural exhibits, such as the  "documenta" art show in Kassel, to build its image in Europe, where  it leads all other carmakers. VW recently stopped sponsoring big-time rock groups such as the Rolling  Stones and Pink Floyd and offering special edition models during their  European concert tours. While other carmakers seek exposure on television with their sponsorship  deals, VW appears more interested in building its support in the local  region and motivating its workforce. "It's a decisive step," said Peter Strahlendorf, publisher of a German  magazine on advertising and marketing. "VW will strengthen its position in the region and show thier strong  ties. Wolfsburg is on the way up and they can use that to their advantage,"  he said. "The VW brand is well known but this should help them to  be viewed as more sympathetic." But VW apparently does not think such sports sponsorhip deals help  long-term sales, a position disputed by Opel, a unit of U.S. carmaker  General Motors Corp. Opel spends about 45 million marks a year, or about 15 to 20 percent  of all advertising and promotional spending, to sponsor top teams  such as Bayern Munich, AC Milan, Paris-St. Germain and the French  and Irish national soccer teams. Some auto industry experts see a small link between sports sponsorship  and bring people into dealerships but note that top carmakers continually  pour money into soccer. Opel alone is estimated to spend about six million marks a year sponsoring  Bayern Munich, which won the Bundesliga last year, while the German  unit of Ford Motor Co spends about three million marks on its hometown  team in Cologne and Korean carmaker Hyundai spends 2.8 million marks  on Hamburger SV. "Anyone who doubts such sponsoring doesn't work should remember that  Opel for years was viewed as a car for old people who even wore hats  inside cars," said Strahlendorf. "Now it is a sportier model and their  market share has certainly risen." --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Tuesday he welcomed the Thai government's economic recovery package. Rubin said Treasury was working closely with the International Monetary Fund on efforts to develop a program that can win international support. "I welcome the August 5 announcement by Thai Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya of a framework for economic recovery," Rubin said in a statement. "I have spoken with the Minister and Treasury is working closely with the IMF."   Rubin said a strong set of economic reforms was the best way to resolve Thailand's current economic difficulties. The Thai government earlier on Tuesday announced tough reforms, including suspending operations at more than half of the country's finance companies, to try to revitalize its economy. The IMF currently has a team in Thailand to assess the government's plan and to work with Bangkok on methods for developing it into a program that could be supported by IMF resources. "I look forward to an early conclusion of technical duscussions between the IMF and the Thai authorities regarding a program that the international community can fully support," Rubin said. -- Washington newsroom, ((202-898-8300))
83167>>0>> Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Thursday that he was receiving "ecouraging reports" from Treasury and International Monetary Fund officials now holding talks in Bangkok with Thai government officials on an IMF-backed economic recovery program. "Assuming conclusion of Thailand's technical discussions with the IMF on a strong and comprehensive recovery program, the United States will fully support Thailand's extraordinary access to IMF resources," Rubin said in a statement.   Rubin cited encouraging reports "about the steps that the Thai authorities are taking, and plan to take, to restore financial market stability and sustainable economic growth" in Thailand. Earlier on Thursday, the IMF announced that lender states and international financial institutions would meet in Tokyo on Monday to discuss an expected multi-billion-dollar loan package aimed at helping Thailand recover economic health.   No information was available in Washington on the likely size of an aid package for Thailand, which sought IMF help reluctantly this week, weeks after a currency crash. Sources in the Thai finance ministry said earlier on Thursday that Thailand was likely to seek $7 billion from Japan, $4 billion from the IMF, $1 billion from the World Bank and $1 billion from the Asian Development Bank.

83167>>0>> German carmaker Volkswagen AG declined comment on Thursday on a published report saying it will have to pay back part of disputed east German subsidies to end a fight with the European Commission. Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported on Thursday that VW would be forced to repay 85 million marks of the 140 million marks it received from the state of Lower Saxony to help build new factories. A VW spokesman said the carmaker, the largest in Europe, was interested in reaching a deal to end the dispute. But VW said on Monday it had rejected European Commission demands that it repay part of the grants. At issue is some 540 million marks of Saxony state subsidies which the EC cleared VW to receive in June 1996. The figure was 241 million marks less than VW and Saxony had originally agreed upon and the subsidy had been hotly contested by the EC as anti-competitive and an unfair advantage for the German carmaker. But rather than paying out only the 540 million marks, Saxony granted VW a 631 million mark investment, leaving VW with 91 million marks more than the EC had agreed. The funds are now are in a bank account, according to VW. VW has suggested that it step up investment in order to offset the additional state subsidies but EC competition officials remain angered by the overpayment. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525

83167>>0>> Iran has arrested two Iraqis and two Iranians on charges of spying for Iraq, the official Iranian news agency IRNA said on Monday. IRNA, quoting an Iranian official in Khuzestan oil province, said the four were trying to smuggle two members of the Iraq-based opposition group Mujahideen Khalq out of Iran. It said the arrests were made last week close to the Iraqi borders. The Mujahideen Khalq has bases and military camps inside Iraq close to the borders with Iran. IRNA said Iran also arrested members of six other Iraqi espionage networks. It did not say how many were involved but said the members were disguised as fishermen and traffickers in a bid to smuggle Mujahideen members in and out of Iran. It said the arrests included three members of Iraq's intelligence service. "They were on a mission to pass on Iran's classified military and economic information to the Iraqi intelligence," it said. Iran last year passed a law imposing the death sentence for espionage, singling out agents working for the United States and Israel.
83167>>0>> Ford Motor Co., moving to boost its manufacturing efficiency in Europe, Tuesday said it hired a top executive away from Volkswagen AG to be its new European production chief. Ford said Rolf Zimmermann will take over the newly created position of general operations manager for European manufacturing on Aug. 18. Zimmermann, 50, worked most of his career at General Motors Corp.'s Adam Opel AG unit in Ruesselsheim, Germany, before jumping to VW at the beginning of 1996. Most recently, he served as president of VW Navarra S.A. in Pamplona, Spain, which builds the Polo subcompact and engines, and also was the chief production officer for Skoda, VW's Czech automotive unit. At Ford, Zimmermann will be responsible for all of Ford's engine, transmission, body and assembly plants, and all manufacturing support functions in Europe. He also will oversee a number of facilities in North and South America and the Asia-Pacific region, Ford said. For the first half of 1997, Ford's European automotive operations earned $262 million, down from $269 million for the first half of 1996. For all of 1996, Ford lost $291 million in Europe. It is the first time Ford has put a single executive directly in charge of manufacturing in Europe. In the past, the chairman of Ford of Europe was responsible for all European business functions, but the position was dissolved last year when Ford put all of its global automotive operations under the control of Jacques Nasser as part of the company's "Ford 2000" structure. Nasser is based at Ford's world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan. With offices in Dunton, England, and Cologne, Germany, Zimmermann will report to John Huston, Ford's U.S.-based chief of engine and transmission operations, and to W. Dale McKeehan, the U.S.-based head of vehicle assembly. Zimmermann's biggest challenge will be to broaden Ford's production and supply base away from Germany and to reduce manufacturing costs to allow the automaker to better compete in a brutal pricing envornment, said Burnham Securities analyst David Healy. If Ford fails to trim costs, it will lose market share and face further capacity reductions, Healy said, adding, "Everybody in Europe is sort of sitting around waiting for the other guy to close plants." Born in Opel's hometown of Ruesselsheim, Zimmermann joined GM in 1961 and managed the company's Zaragosa, Spain, plant in the 1980s before taking charge of the giant Opel plant in Ruesselsheim from 1992 to September 1995. He then briefly came to the United States to work in GM's Delphi Automotive Systems parts operations before joining VW in early 1996. He went to work in VW's production operations at a time when Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua was still the German automaker's manufacturing chief -- and worked with Lopez at GM. But both GM and Ford spokesmen tried to distance Zimmermann from the embattled Lopez, who was charged in Germany last December along with three associates with stealing GM corporate secrets when he and several other managers left GM to join VW in 1993. "He didn't have anything to do with Lopez," said Bert Serre, a Ford spokesman in Dearborn. "We've hired a guy who has good experience and good background." Lopez quit VW in November 1996. In January, VW cut a deal to end GM's U.S. civil racketeering suit over the allegations, agreeing to pay GM $100 million and buy $1 billion worth of GM parts over seven years. Despite the controversy, analysts credit Lopez' manufacturing team with slashing VW's manufacturing costs by billions of dollars.

83167>>0>> A crowded ferry collided with barges and overturned outside Hanoi throwing dozens of people into the water and killing at least four, a city official said on Wednesday. More than 20 passengers were missing. The official, who declined to be identified, said the ferry struck the barges on Monday night as it was attempting to pass them in a narrow channel on the Red River just north of the city. It capsized immediately spilling people and cargo into the river. By Wednesday morning 73 people had been rescued. More than 20 families had reported members still missing. The accident was not reported by state media on Monday or Tuesday for reasons which were not clear. Survivors were quoted by local newspapers on Wednesday as saying the ferry captain and crew had shouted warnings to the barge operators, who failed to respond. Some passengers tried to stop the collision by fending off the vessels by hand. They were tossed into the river as the force of the barges overturned the ferry. The area of the accident, close to a major Soviet-built Bridge, was the scene of another ferry disaster three years ago in which 28 people died. The official said efforts to recover bodies were continuing, but it was likely to take several days before all were found because of fast-moving currents which were likely to have swept people downstream. Police said nine people, all members of the barge crew, had been arrested.
83167>>0>> At least four people drowned after a pleasure boat, carrying mostly Hong Kong tourists, capsized after being battered by high winds in Manila Bay on Friday, Navy officials said. The owner of the outrigger told reporters that the holiday-makers panicked after strong winds and high waves rocked the King George as it was heading back to port. "The guests panicked. They all went to one side of the boat," he said. "The boat suddenly tipped (after) ... the passenger rushed to the right side of the boat ... I was shocked," the captain, Romeo Farolan said. Many of the passengers were able to grab life jackets before the boat turned over. Navy spokesman Salvador Cuba said at least 44 tourists, mostly from Hong Kong and some from Japan, two Filipino tour guides, and three crew were on board when it capsized seven miles off the Navy headquarters. Most were rescued but officials said six were still unaccounted for. Rescue operations led by four navy vessels and a commercial ship were going on into the night. "Our divers are swimming to see if there is anyone left inside the boat," Cuba said. A tourism department representative said the tourists had only just arrived in the Philippine capital and immediately went on a sightseeing tour around Manila Bay late in the afternoon. It was the second boat disaster in the day in the Philippines. Earlier, an inter-island vessel sank in Samar sea off the central island of Biliran, drowning 13 people, including a baby girl, while 47 others were missing.
83167>>0>> Four foreigners drowned and at least 15 people were missing after a pleasure boat sank in Manila Bay on Friday afternoon, officials said. Navy spokesman Salvador Cuba said 28 survivors, including at least seven children, were rescued. Milo Villena, a doctor at a nearby hospital, said three women and a child had died. At least 15 people were unaccounted for, officials said. Helen Wong, one of the survivors, said about 45 foreigners and two Filipino tourist guides were on a sightseeing tour of Manila Bay when strong wind turned over their boat which was on its way back to the dock. Radio reports said the boat had 43 Hong Kong Chinese and two Japanese on board. The vessel sank seven nautical miles from the Philippine Navy headquarters. "I'm still waiting for my mother-in-law," Wong sobbed.
83167>>0>> The death toll after a tourist-packed pleasure boat capsized in Manila Bay has risen to seven after police retrieved the body of a four-year-old Hong Kong boy, the Philippine Navy said on Saturday. Thirty nine others, mostly Hong Kong Chinese nationals and four Filipinos, had been rescued, Navy spokesman Salvador Cuba told Reuters. "The description matches that of the four-year old Hong Kong Chinese national who was reported missing. But we have asked the parents to identify the body," Cuba told Reuters by phone. Rescuers also fished out early on Saturday two floating bodies in the bay. Four bodies, were retrieved Friday, including that of a 12-year old boy, after huge waves and strong winds overturned King Rogers. All six were Hong Kong Chinese. "A Hong Kong national hugged the dead body of his wife and cried like a child after we retrived the body from the sea," a Navy officer told reporters. The survivors of the accident wailed along the shores of Manila Bay as buddhist monks chanted prayers and lighted incense for the dead early on Saturday. Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor said the five-tonne, double-decked boat was rocked by high waves ten minutes after it left the pier. The King Rogers had only moved about 30 feet from the shore before it capsized, Gabor said, quoting one survivor. The owner of the outrigger told reporters that the holiday-makers, who were planning to watch the sunset in the bay, had panicked as the boat began rocking on its way back to port. "The guests panicked. They all went to one side of the boat," he said. "The boat suddenly tipped (after)...the passenger rushed to the right side of the boat....I was shocked," said the captain, Romeo Farolan. Many of the passengers were able to grab life jackets before the boat turned over. Gabor said 42 tourists, mostly from Hong Kong, were on board when the boat capsized. "Everybody's accounted for now, there were 42 tourists on board, two Filipino crew, and two other Filipino guides," Cuba said. The Philippine Coast Guard said it will investigate if the boat was overloaded. The Manila Bay accident was the third ferry accident in the country in 24 hours. On Friday, eleven were killed after high waves buffeted another inter-island ferry off Biliran province, 480 km (298 miles) south of Manila. At least three people drowned and a boy was missing after strong winds and high waves sank another outrigger off the coast of Masbate island late on Thursday, officials said. Ferry accidents are common in this archipelago where monsoon rains lash the Philippine islands for about five months every year.
83167>>0>> The death toll after a pleasure boat packed with foreign tourists capsized in Manila Bay has risen to at least six, the Philippine navy said on Saturday. At least six Hong Kong Chinese nationals were killed and a four-year old boy was still missing a day after huge waves swamped the boat, officials said. The boy was also a Hong Kong Chinese. Thirty-eight foreign tourists were rescued, Navy spokesman Salvador Cuba said. "Two more bodies of a man and a woman floated early this morning, bringing the dead to six," he said.

"This is the third boat accident reported to us in 24 hours," a coast guard official told Reuters. The inter-island boat, with an undetermined number of passengers, sank late on Thursday, reports reaching the coast guard said. The Philippine Coast Guard is still searching the area for possible survivors, spokesman Joel Garcia said.

83167>>0>> U.S. fund manager Janus Capital Corporation has acquired 1.4 million ordinary shares, or a 5.09 percent stake, in Volkswagen AG, the German car maker said. VW said in a regulatory news release on Friday that Janus had acquired the stake by August 1. The holding would make Janus the second largest shareholder in VW after the German state of Lower Saxony, the carmaker's home state, which owns 20 percent. Janus also holds a further 17,745 American Depositary Receipts, which VW said do not have voting rights. VW officials were not immediately available on Saturday to comment on the shareholding, and nobody could be reached at Janus. VW will announce first half results on Monday which are expected to show a solid jump. Analysts expect group net profit to hit 500 million marks, compared to year-earlier earnings of 282 million marks. Group sales are seen climbing to 56 billion marks from 50 billion a year ago. VW shares fell on Friday by 25 marks to 1,292 marks, below a year-high of 1,485 marks in July, but more than double the levels seen at the start of this year.
83167>>0>> The lawyer for an Israeli man charged with spying in Egypt tried on Sunday to prove his client innocent by blasting prosecution evidence against his alleged Egyptian accomplice. Farid el-Deeb, lawyer for Israeli Druze textile engineer Azam Azam, raised questions about the sequence of events leading to Emad Ismail's alleged recruitment by the Israeli secret service Mossad. Azam and Ismail are charged with making criminal arrangements to spy in Egypt for Mossad. They have pleaded not guilty. Two women -- Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna -- are on trial in absentia for the same charges. In Sunday's session, Deeb highlighted inconsistencies in the prosecution case against Ismail. He told the court that Ismail's alleged confession said he signed a cooperation form with a Mossad agent on May 25, 1996. However Deeb claimed interrogation reports showed that Ismail had said he agreed to work for Mossad the following month. Among the charges levelled against Ismail was that he provided information on Egypt's industry to Mossad. But Deeb said such information was easy to obtain and presented to the judge free government publications on factories in new satellite cities. According to investigators, Azam is alleged to have given Ismail women's underwear marked with Mossad's invisible ink to take into Egypt. Deeb said expert testimony on the alleged invisible ink was inconsistent. Deeb added that Ismail had also filed a complaint against torture, saying he had written to the judge in February on an empty cigarette packet. When asked by his lawyer and the judge, Maharram Darwish, Ismail confirmed he wrote the note. In the complaint, Ismail said: "I am subjected to the ugliest forms of torture, which lead to slow death. "It includes solitary confinement for 105 days till now (February)... scarce food, drink and medicine, the refusal to go to the toilet or to leave my cell for more than 24 hours." The two defendants, handcuffed to policemen, stood silently in the courtroom cage during the State Security Court trial. Asaad Asaad, a prominent Druze figure and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's adviser, and Israeli diplomats in Cairo attended the session. The hearing resumes on Monday.
83167>>0>> Philippine President Fidel Ramos on Monday called for punishment of negligent shipowners after three domestic passenger boats sank during one day last week. At least 22 people died in the latest string of sea tragedies to occur in a country with an appalling maritime safety record, including the world's worst peace-time sea disaster. "The tragic but avoidable disasters of a few days ago occurring within a span of 24 hours underlines the need to stop, prevent and punish the neglect and the greed that lead to the unnecessary loss of lives, property and good will," Ramos said in a speech. He said one of the incidents, in which seven Hong Kong Chinese tourists drowned on Friday after their sightseeing boat King Rogers capsized in choppy waters in Manila Bay, occurred near the Navy headquarters. Manila police homicide chief Pete Angulo said on Monday police had arrested Rogelio Alenzuela, owner of the King Rogers and two crewmen on charges of reckless imprudence resulting in multiple homicide. Two other crewmen were at large, Angulo told reporters. In the two other incidents, 15 people died when an outrigger and inter-island ferry sank in the central Philippines. Maritime accidents occur frequently in the Philippines, an archipelago of 7,100 islands where ferries are the cheapest and most popular means of transport. Officials have blamed most of the disasters on overcrowding, badly trained crews and owners skimping on safety gear. At least 4,000 people died when the ferry Dona Paz sank in December 1987 after a collision with an oil tanker in history's worst peace-time maritime tragedy.
83167>>0>> A Mongolian court has ruled that former espionage chief General J. Baatar was not guilty of illegally spying on opposition party leaders, judges said on Monday. A closed-door court session decided last week that Baatar, former chief of the Centre for Espionage, was not guilty of misusing his position or ordering illegal spying activities. "After examining the charges of ordering illegal spying and misuse of position, our court decided he was not guilty," judge Minjirmaa of the Chingeltei district court told Reuters. The court gave no details of the session that ended late on Friday, saying it was a state secret. "There were no documents nor any witnesses against me," Baatar, who now works as a government expert in strategic leadership, said in an interview. "The accusations were merely political." Baatar was dismissed last December, only a few months after he was appointed by the new Democratic Union Coalition Prime Minister M. Enkhsaikhan, after a parliamentary committee said it found evidence of illegal surveillance on opposition party leaders. The committee said the Centre had bugged the telephones of the ex-communist Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP), which was unseated in general elections in June, 1996. Members of parlament have said those abuses were only a part of a larger pattern of illegal activities by the Centre that began well before the MPRP was unseated in the elections. The Centre for Espionage was dismantled last December and replaced by the Centre for National Security.
83167>>0>> An Egyptian state security court will this month pass its verdict on an Israeli man and his alleged Egyptian accomplice on charges they spied on Egypt for the Jewish state. Maharram Darwish, the main judge in a session of the trial held at a Cairo state security court on Monday, said he would hand down the verdict on August 31. Israeli Druze textile technician Azam Azam and Egyptian Emad Abdelhalim Ismail are charged with making criminal arrangements to spy for the Israeli intelligence service Mossad. The case has brought Egypt-Israeli ties to one of their lowest points since their 1979 peace treaty. Two women -- Zahra Youssef Greiss and Mona Ahmed Shawahna -- are on trial in absentia on the same charges. Like Azam, they are also members of the Druze community. The trial, which started on April 24, resumed on Sunday and continued on Monday. Azam's lawyer, Farid el-Deeb, tried to prove his client's innocence by saying that there was no evidence to support Ismail's espionage charge. Among the charges against Ismail was that he accepted a bribe to spy for Mossad. "He took $400, $100 and $150, but only to help him in his living," Deeb said. But the defence for Ismail had said in an earlier session that there was no proof his client took money. Ismail is also charged with providing information on Egypt's industry to Mossad. Deeb argued in Monday's hearing that such information was publicly available and presented to the judge a copy of the business directory Kompass on Egypt. He said any talk between Ismail and Greiss, who is charged with trying to recruit him, was normal conversation. "Such a case is harmful to Egypt. Egypt is so strong and deeply rooted to be hurt by a normal conversation," Deeb said. Prosecutor Hisham Badawi asked for the maximum punishment for the defendants, saying they deserved no mercy. Lawyers say Ismail faces 25 years in jail with hard labour. Azam faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, lawyers said. "We trust your just verdict, for which millions of people are waiting," Badawi told the court.
83167>>0>> German carmaker Volkswagen AG said on Monday it expected to report higher pre-tax and net profit for 1997 compared with 1996 levels. VW in 1996 reported a group net profit of 678 million marks, while sales rose 14 percent to 100.1 billion marks. The carmaker earlier on Monday said first-half group net profit rose 73 percent to 488 million marks, while group sales rose 12 percent to 1.674 billion marks. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
83167>>0>> Shares in Volkswagen AG kept up their advance on Tuesday following strong first-half results on Monday and prospects for the German carmaker's introduction of a new generation of its popular Golf model. VW shares were up 65 marks at 1,350 marks in early bourse dealings. Dealers said some banks had reaffirmed buy ratings on the Wolfsburg-based carmaker on the six-month results, which showed a 73 percent rise in group net profit to 488 million marks and a 12 percent rise in sales to 56.55 billion marks. "VW remains our top pick in the DAX," said a dealer at one major international bank who declined to be identified. Some traders tied the fresh gains to VW chief executive Ferdinand Piech saying in a German television interview late on Monday that VW expected 700,000 sales in Europe of the Golf in its first year of production. --Frankfurt Newsroom, +49 69 756525
